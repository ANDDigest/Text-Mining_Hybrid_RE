This folder contains the archive with a dataset of protein embeddings, obtained by the performing of `st1.train_gnn.py` script from the main folder. for the training of the classification model based on the Multi Layer Perceptron with three hidden layers.

## Content

### 1. `PPI_mlp_model.pth`
`PPI_mlp_model.pth` - the weights in the PyTorch serialized tensors format of our MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model, trained for predicting edges between the protein pairs based on the Graph structure. These weights were utilized in our study.
