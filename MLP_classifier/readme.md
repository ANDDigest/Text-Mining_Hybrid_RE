This folder contains the trained binary classification model based on the Multi Layer Perceptron with three hidden layers.

## Content

### `PPI_mlp_model.pth`
`PPI_mlp_model.pth` - the weights in the PyTorch serialized tensors format of our MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model, trained for predicting edges between the protein pairs based on the Graph structure. These weights were utilized in our study.

### `dataset`
`dataset` - the folder contains examples of the dataset format used in the training of MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model.
