HPRD50.d1 HPRD50.d1.s0.e0 HPRD50.d1.s0.e1	monocyte chemotactic protein-1	CCR2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 10529171 Identification of residues in the monocyte chemotactic protein-1 that contact the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2. The CC chemokine, MCP-1, has been identified as a major chemoattractant for T cells and monocytes, and plays a significant role in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. To identify the regions of MCP-1 that contact its receptor, CCR2, we substituted all surface-exposed residues with alanine. Some residues were also mutated to other amino acids to identify the importance of charge, hydrophobicity, or aromaticity at specific positions. The binding affinity of each mutant for CCR2 was assayed with THP-1 and CCR2-transfected CHL cells. The majority of point mutations had no effect. Residues at the N-terminus of the protein, known to be crucial for signaling, contribute less than a factor of 10 to the binding affinity. However, two clusters of primarily basic residues (R24, K35, K38, K49, and Y13), separated by a 35 A hydrophobic groove, reduced the level of binding by 15-100-fold. A peptide fragment encompassing residues 13-35 recapitulated some of the mutational data derived from the intact protein. It exhibited modest binding as a linear peptide and dramatically improved affinity when the region which adopts a single turn of a 3(10)-helix in the protein, which includes R24, was constrained by a disulfide bond. Additional constraints at the ends of the peptide, corresponding to the disulfide between the first and third cysteines in MCP-1, yielded further improvements in affinity. Together, these data suggest a model in which a large surface area of MCP-1 contacts the receptor, and the accumulation of a number of weak interactions results in the 35 pM affinity observed for the wild-type (WT) protein. The receptor binding site of MCP-1 also is significantly different from the binding sites of RANTES and IL-8, providing insight into the issue of receptor specificity. It was previously shown that the N-terminus of CCR2 is critical for binding MCP-1 [Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19084-92; Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 23186-90]. Point mutations of six acidic residues in this region of the receptor were made to test their role in ligand binding. This identified D25 and D27 of the DYDY motif as being important. On the basis of our data, we propose a model in which the receptor N-terminus lies along the hydrophobic groove in an extended fashion, placing the DYDY motif near the basic cluster involving R24 and K49 of MCP-1. This in turn orients the signaling residues (Y13 and the N-terminus) for productive interaction with the receptor.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [monocyte chemotactic protein-1 protein] and [CCR2 protein] interact with each other?

BACKGROUND: A number of recent studies have identified interleukin (IL)-6 as an important regulator of prostate cancer growth. Here, we investigate the potential interaction of IL-6 with phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase, a key growth regulatory enzyme, in prostate cancer cell lines. METHODS: Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase, in the human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 was assessed by sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-p85 antibody and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. The effects of wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI-3 kinase, and/or IL-6 on cell growth were assessed by MTT assays. DNA laddering experiments were performed to assay for programmed cell death. RESULTS: Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 is upregulated by IL-6 in both LNCaP and PC-3. IL-6 promotes coprecipitation of p85 with gp130, the signal-transducing component of the IL-6 receptor. Inhibition of PI-3 kinase with wortmannin induces programmed cell death in PC-3 cells. In contrast, wortmannin has no effect on LNCaP growth when used alone; however, combined with IL-6, wortmannin promotes apoptosis in these cells.

Intracellular signaling pathways, which regulate the interactions of integrins with their ligands, affect a wide variety of biological functions. Here we provide evidence of how cytohesin-1, an integrin-binding protein and guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF GTPases, regulates cell adhesion. Mutational analyses of the beta-2 cytoplasmic domain revealed that the adhesive function of LFA-1 depends on its interaction with cytohesin-1, unless the integrin is activated by exogenous divalent cations. Secondly, cytohesin-1 induces expression of an extracellular activation epitope of LFA-1, and the exchange factor function is not essential for this activity. In contrast, LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 is strongly inhibited by a cytohesin-1 mutant, which fails to catalyze ARF GDP-GTP exchange in vitro. Thus, cytohesin-1 is involved in the activation of LFA-1, most probably through direct interaction with the integrin, and induces cell spreading by its ARF-GEF activity.

We have studied the transcription regulation of the rat thromboxane synthase (TXS) gene by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in macrophages. The transcription activity of a cloned 5'-flanking region (1.6 kilobases) of the rat TXS gene (5'FL-TXS) was examined by luciferase reporter gene assay. TXS mRNA expression and the transcription activity of 5'FL-TXS were inhibited by PPARgamma ligands, 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (PGJ(2)), and the thiazolidinedione troglitazone (TRO) in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of PPARgamma also significantly suppressed transcription, and further addition of PGJ(2) or TRO augmented the suppression. Deletion analysis showed that the element responsible for the PPARgamma effect is located in a region containing the nuclear factor E2 (NF-E2)/AP-1 site (-98/-88), which was indicated to be the major promoter of the TXS gene. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the NF-E2/AP-1 site and nuclear extracts from macrophages, we observed a specific protein-DNA complex formation, which was inhibited by a specific antibody against the transcription factor NRF2 (NF-E2-related factor 2). Moreover, the complex was decreased with PGJ(2), TRO, or in vitro translated PPARgamma. The transcription suppression by PPARgamma was confirmed using this truncated NRF2-binding element (-98/-88) by the reporter gene assay. Finally, a direct interaction between PPARgamma and NRF2 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay. In conclusion, the NRF2-binding site (-98/-88) is the major promoter of 5'FL-TXS which can be suppressed by activated PPARgamma via a protein-protein interaction with NRF2 in macrophages.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma protein] and [NRF2 protein] interact with each other?

ADAM 12, a member of the ADAM family of transmembrane metalloprotease-disintegrins, has been implicated previously in the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts. In the present study, we show that the cytoplasmic tail of mouse ADAM 12 interacts in vitro and in vivo with the Src homology 3 domain of the p85alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified three p85alpha-binding sites in ADAM 12 involving PXXP motifs located at amino acids 825-828, 833-836, and 884-887. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-pleckstrin homology (PH) domain fusion protein as a probe for PI 3-kinase lipid products, we have further demonstrated that expression of ADAM 12 in C2C12 cells resulted in translocation of GFP-PH to the plasma membrane. This suggests that transmembrane ADAM 12, by providing docking sites for the Src homology 3 domain of p85alpha, activates PI 3-kinase by mediating its recruitment to the membrane.

In mammalian cells, LIS1 recruitment to kinetochores is dynein/dynactin dependent, and recruitment there of CLIP-170 is dependent on its site of binding to LIS1, located in the distal zinc finger motif. Overexpression of CLIP-170 results in a zinc finger-dependent localization of a phospho-LIS1 isoform and dynactin to MT bundles, raising the possibility that CLIP-170 and LIS1 regulate dynein/dynactin binding to MTs. This work suggests that LIS1 is a regulated adapter between CLIP-170 and cytoplasmic dynein at sites involved in cargo-MT loading, and/or in the control of MT dynamics.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CLIP-170 protein] and [LIS1 protein] interact with each other?

HPRD50.d18 HPRD50.d18.s0.e1 HPRD50.d18.s0.e2	DEP1	p120(ctn)	[INST]Context: [PMID: 12370829 The transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP1 interacts with p120(ctn). The receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP1, also known as CD148, is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells, in a variety of tumor cell lines, and in lymphocytes. Expression of DEP1 is enhanced at high cell density, and this observation suggests that DEP1 may function in the regulation of cell adhesion and possibly contact inhibition of cell growth. In order to investigate the function of DEP1, substrate-trapping mutants of the phosphatase were used to identify potential substrates. GST-fusion proteins containing the DEP1 catalytic domain with a substrate-trapping D/A mutation were found to interact with p120(ctn), a component of adherens junctions. DEP1 also interacted with other members of the catenin gene family including beta-catenin and gamma-catenin. The interaction with p120(ctn) is likely to be direct, as the interaction occurs in K562 cells lacking functional adherens junctions and E-cadherin expression. Catalytic domains of the tyrosine phosphatases PTP-PEST, CD45, and PTPbeta did not interact with proteins of the catenin family to detectable levels, suggesting that the interaction of DEP1 with these proteins is specific. DEP1 expression was concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact in A549 cells. p120(ctn) was found to colocalize with these structures. Together these data suggest an important role for DEP-1 in the function of cell-cell contacts and adherens junctions.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [DEP1 protein] and [p120(ctn) protein] interact with each other?

The receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP1, also known as CD148, is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells, in a variety of tumor cell lines, and in lymphocytes. Expression of DEP1 is enhanced at high cell density, and this observation suggests that DEP1 may function in the regulation of cell adhesion and possibly contact inhibition of cell growth. In order to investigate the function of DEP1, substrate-trapping mutants of the phosphatase were used to identify potential substrates. GST-fusion proteins containing the DEP1 catalytic domain with a substrate-trapping D/A mutation were found to interact with p120(ctn), a component of adherens junctions. DEP1 also interacted with other members of the catenin gene family including beta-catenin and gamma-catenin. The interaction with p120(ctn) is likely to be direct, as the interaction occurs in K562 cells lacking functional adherens junctions and E-cadherin expression. Catalytic domains of the tyrosine phosphatases PTP-PEST, CD45, and PTPbeta did not interact with proteins of the catenin family to detectable levels, suggesting that the interaction of DEP1 with these proteins is specific. DEP1 expression was concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact in A549 cells. p120(ctn) was found to colocalize with these structures.

Ribosome biogenesis requires a vast number of trans-acting factors many of which are required for the chemical modification and processing of the pre-rRNA component. The U3 snoRNP complex is required for the early cleavage steps in pre-rRNA processing. We have cloned cDNAs encoding the human and mouse homologs of the yeast U3 snoRNP-associated proteins Imp3 and Imp4. Both human proteins localize to nucleoli and interact with the U3 snoRNA. The results of complementation experiments show that, in contrast to mouse Imp4, mouse Imp3 can partially alleviate the growth defect of the corresponding yeast null strain, indicating that the role of Imp3 in pre-rRNA processing is evolutionarily conserved. The results of density gradient centrifugation experiments show that, in contrast to hU3-55K, the human Imp3 and Imp4 proteins predominantly interact with the U3 snoRNA in 60-80S ribonucleoprotein complexes. In addition, we have found that hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 can form a stable hetero-trimeric complex in vitro, which is generated by direct interactions of both hImp3 and hImp4 with hMpp10. The analysis of hImp3 and hImp4 mutants indicated that their binding to hMpp10 correlates with their nucleolar accumulation, strongly suggesting that the formation of the ternary complex of hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 is required for their association with nucleolar components.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Imp3 protein] and [Imp4 protein] interact with each other?

Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Crk. To identify new binding partners for GAB proteins and better understand their functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with hGab2-(120-587) as bait. This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases. The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned CdGAP and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro. The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42. GC-GAP is predominantly expressed in the brain with low levels detected in other tissues. Antibodies directed against GC-GAP recognized a protein of approximately 200 kDa. Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA. Suppression of GC-GAP expression by siRNA inhibited proliferation of C6 astroglioma cells. In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro. We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities. Given that GC-GAP is specifically expressed in the nervous system and that it is localized to the dendritic processes of cultured neurons, GC-GAP may play a role in dendritic morphogenesis and also possibly in neural/glial cell proliferation.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GC-GAP protein] and [Gab1 protein] interact with each other?

Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Crk. To identify new binding partners for GAB proteins and better understand their functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with hGab2-(120-587) as bait. This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases. The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned CdGAP and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro. The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42. GC-GAP is predominantly expressed in the brain with low levels detected in other tissues. Antibodies directed against GC-GAP recognized a protein of approximately 200 kDa. Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA. Suppression of GC-GAP expression by siRNA inhibited proliferation of C6 astroglioma cells. In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro. We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities.

HPRD50.d24 HPRD50.d24.s1.e2 HPRD50.d24.s1.e3	oncostatin M	LDLR	[INST]Context: [PMID: 12947119 Specific interaction of Egr1 and c/EBPbeta leads to the transcriptional activation of the human low density lipoprotein receptor gene. The sterol-independent regulatory element (SIRE) of the LDL receptor (LDLR) promoter mediates oncostatin M (OM)-induced transcription of the LDLR gene through a cholesterol-independent pathway. Our prior studies have detected specific associations of the zinc finger transcription factor Egr1 with the SIRE sequence in OM-stimulated HepG2 cells. Because the SIRE motif is composed of a c/EBP binding site and a cAMP response element, both of which are quite divergent from the classical GC-rich Egr1 recognition sequences, we hypothesized that Egr1 may regulate LDLR transcription through interacting with members of the c/EBP and CREB families. Here, we show that treating HepG2 cells with OM specifically leads to prominent increases of the levels of c/EBPbeta and Egr1 bound to the LDLR promoter in vivo. In vitro, the binding of Egr1 to the SIRE sequence is weak, but is strikingly enhanced in the presence of HepG2 nuclear extract. Mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrate that the N-terminal transactivation domain of Egr1 specifically interacts with c/EBPbeta but not with c/EBPalpha or CREB. The OM treatment further enhances this interaction, resulting in a large increase in the Egr1 transactivating activity. The direct protein to protein contact between Egr1 and c/EBPbeta is also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, we show that a mutation of the phosphorylation motif of c/EBPbeta diminished the OM-stimulated interaction of Egr1 and c/EBPbeta.

The protein pVHL functions in a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor Hif1 alpha for proteasomal degradation during normoxia. We establish that pVHL binds to Tat-binding protein-1 (TBP-1), a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome. TBP-1 associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and Hif1 alpha in vivo.

PURPOSE: Pinin (Pnn/DRS/memA) is a cell-adhesion-related and nuclear protein that has been identified as central in the establishment and maintenance of corneal epithelial cell-cell adhesion. To begin the elucidation of the role of Pnn within the nucleus of corneal epithelial cells, this study was undertaken to identify the proteins that bind to Pnn. METHODS: Yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed. A human cDNA library in the pGAD-10 vector and C-terminal region of human Pnn (465-717) in a pAS2-1 vector were cotransformed into the PJ69-4A yeast strain, containing the lacZ, HIS3, and ADE2 reporter genes. To dissect domains of Pnn responsible for mediating the interaction with the identified proteins, PNN fragments were ligated with the DNA-binding domain of the pAS2-1 vector. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-T, RCB1384) and HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with mammalian expression vectors containing Pnn with identified interacting partners and subsequently immunostained and immunoblotted to determine expressed and endogenous proteins. RESULTS: Pnn colocalized and copurified with serine-arginine (SR) proteins. Three SR-rich proteins were identified that interact with the C-terminus of Pnn: SRp75 and SRm300, known components of spliceosome machinery, and a novel 130-kDa nuclear protein, SRrp130. All of these proteins colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with one another and exhibited speckled nuclear distribution that aligned with components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. The cDNA for SRrp130 encoded a protein of 805 amino acid residues and contained multiple arginine-serine (RS) repeats but had no RNA recognition motif. Analysis of the Pnn motifs using two-hybrid system assays demonstrated that the polyserine/RS motif within Pnn plays a central but not exclusive role in mediating molecular interactions with identified SR-rich proteins.

Human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-T, RCB1384) and HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with mammalian expression vectors containing Pnn with identified interacting partners and subsequently immunostained and immunoblotted to determine expressed and endogenous proteins. RESULTS: Pnn colocalized and copurified with serine-arginine (SR) proteins. Three SR-rich proteins were identified that interact with the C-terminus of Pnn: SRp75 and SRm300, known components of spliceosome machinery, and a novel 130-kDa nuclear protein, SRrp130. All of these proteins colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with one another and exhibited speckled nuclear distribution that aligned with components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. The cDNA for SRrp130 encoded a protein of 805 amino acid residues and contained multiple arginine-serine (RS) repeats but had no RNA recognition motif. Analysis of the Pnn motifs using two-hybrid system assays demonstrated that the polyserine/RS motif within Pnn plays a central but not exclusive role in mediating molecular interactions with identified SR-rich proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Pnn and SR-rich proteins may be part of a multiprotein complex within the nucleus and may be involved in pre-mRNA processing.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [DRS protein] and [SRm300 protein] interact with each other?

The Ras and Raf1 proto-oncogenes transduce extracellular signals that promote cell growth. Cdc25 phosphatases activate the cell division cycle by dephosphorylation of critical threonine and tyrosine residues within the cyclin-dependent kinases. We show here that Cdc25 phosphatase associates with raf1 in somatic mammalian cells and in meiotic frog oocytes. Furthermore, Cdc25 phosphatase can be activated in vitro in a Raf1-dependent manner.

Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of perlecan, a specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan, to the beta-amyloid protein (A beta)-containing amyloid deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. In the present investigation, the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell (EC)- and smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived PGs to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits may be due to its interactions with perlecan. Pretreatment of AA amyloidotic splenic and liver tissue sections with synthetic A beta (1-28) produced strong immunoreactivity with A beta antibodies at tissue sites enriched in perlecan which was partially removed by pretreatment with heparitinase, but not by chondroitin ABC lyase. [35S]-Sulfate labeled proteoglycans (PGs) derived from cultured ECs and SMCs bound to affinity columns containing A beta (1-28) or (1-40), with virtually no binding to A beta (40-1) (reverse peptide), beta-amyloid precursor protein (410-429), or bovine serum albumin. Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan, weak binding by decorin and biglycan, two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Binding of 125I-labeled perlecan to A beta (1-28) was strongly inhibited by isolated perlecan and to a lesser extent by heparin, but not by chondroitin-6-sulfate or unsulfated dextran sulfate. Heparitinase treatment decreased, but did not eliminate the binding of 125I-labeled perlecan to A beta (1-28).

Involucrin was the first protein to be identified as a likely constituent of the insoluble cornified cell envelope (CE) of stratified squamous epithelia. However, to date, direct isolation from CEs of involucrin cross-linked by way of the transglutaminase-induced isopeptide bond has not been reported. We have treated human foreskin CEs with methanol/KOH (saponification) to hydrolyze off much of the lipids. By immunogold electron microscopy, this exposed large amounts of involucrin epitopes as well as of desmoplakin, a desmosomal structural protein. About 20% of the total CE protein could be solubilized by proteolytic digestion after saponification, of which involucrin was the most abundant. Subsequent amino acid sequencing revealed many peptides involving involucrin cross-linked either to itself or to a variety of other known CE protein components, including cystatin alpha, desmoplakin, elafin, keratins, members of the small proline-rich superfamily, loricrin, and unknown proteins related to the desmoplakin family. Specific glutamines or lysines of involucrin were used to cross-link the different proteins, such as glutamines 495 and 496 to desmoplakin, glutamine 288 to keratins, and lysines 468, 485, and 508 and glutamines 465 and 489 for interchain involucrin cross-links. Many identical peptides were obtained from immature CEs isolated from the inner living cell layers of foreskin epidermis. The multiple cross-linked partners of involucrin provide experimental confirmation that involucrin is an important early scaffold protein in the CE.

However, to date, direct isolation from CEs of involucrin cross-linked by way of the transglutaminase-induced isopeptide bond has not been reported. We have treated human foreskin CEs with methanol/KOH (saponification) to hydrolyze off much of the lipids.

HPRD50.d6 HPRD50.d6.s4.e0 HPRD50.d6.s4.e1	Jak2	STAT3	[INST]Context: [PMID: 10925297 Regulation of neutrophil adhesion by pituitary growth hormone accompanies tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, p125FAK, and paxillin. Neutrophil adhesion is fundamentally important during the onset of inflammatory responses. The adhesion signaling pathways control neutrophil arrest and extravasation and influence neutrophil shape and function at sites of inflammation. In the present study the intracellular signaling pathways for the adhesion of human neutrophils by pituitary growth hormone (GH) were examined. Pituitary GH triggered the tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and STAT3 in neutrophils. In addition, pituitary GH treatment resulted in the morphological changes and the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) and paxillin. Preincubation with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the GH-stimulated adhesion and Jak2, STAT3, p125FAK, and paxillin phosphorylation. Confocal microscopy revealed that pituitary GH stimulates the focal localization of p125FAK, paxillin, phosphotyrosine, and filamentous actin filament into the membrane rufflings and uropods of human neutrophils. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a physical association of Jak2 with p125FAK via STAT3 in vivo. Also an in vitro kinase assay showed an augmentation of p125FAK autophosphorylation as a result of pituitary GH treatment. These results suggest that pituitary GH modulates neutrophil adhesion through tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, p125FAK, and paxillin and actin polymerization.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Jak2 protein] and [STAT3 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence; Explanation: The context clearly states that sialoadhesin (Siglec-1) binds to CD43, a glycoprotein found on T lymphocytes. This binding is sialic acid dependent and is abolished by mutation of a critical residue in the sialic acid binding site of sialoadhesin. Additionally, CD43 expressed in COS cells supports increased binding to immobilized sialoadhesin, further confirming the interaction between these two proteins.</s>

We recently found a novel GPI-anchored protein, GPI-80, on human phagocytes that may regulate leukocyte adherence, locomotion, and extravasation. To clarify the mechanisms by which GPI-80 functions on leukocytes, we explored the possibility of its physical association with beta 2 integrin which is important for leukocyte adherence, locomotion, and extravasation. beta 2 integrin, detected by anti-CD18 mAb, was coprecipitated with GPI-80 from human neutrophil lysates by a mAb to GPI-80. In addition, GPI-80 was immunoprecipitated from human neutrophil lysates by anti-human CD18 mAb. These results clearly show that GPI-80 is physically associated with beta 2 integrin in human neutrophils.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GPI-80 protein] and [CD18 protein] interact with each other?

Cross-linking B cell antigen receptor (BCR) elicits early signal transduction events, including activation of protein tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of receptor components, activation of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma), and increases in intracellular free Ca2+. In this article, we report that cross-linking the BCR led to a rapid translocation of cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1C to the particulate fraction, where it became associated with a 140-150-kD tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein. Western blotting analysis identified this 140-150-kD protein to be CD22. The association of PTP-1C with CD22 was mediated by the NH2-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of PTP-1C.

For unknown reasons, the eukaryotic transcription factor TFIID inefficiently recognizes promoters. Human TFIID was found to form highly specific homodimers that must dissociate before DNA binding. TFIID dimers formed through self-association of the TATA-binding polypeptide (TBP) subunit and could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to TAF(II)250, the core subunit of TFIID. Chemical cross-linking experiments in HeLa cells revealed the presence of TBP dimers in vivo. These findings suggest that dimerization through TBP is the physiological state of TFIID when not bound to DNA. Thus, the inefficiency of TFIID binding to a promoter may be partly attributable to the competitive effect of dimerization.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [TFIID protein] and [TAF(II)250 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence; Explanation: The context indicates that TFIID dimers can be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to TAF(II)250, the core subunit of TFIID. This suggests that TFIID and TAF(II)250 proteins interact with each other as part of the TFIID complex. The formation of TFIID dimers through self-association of the TATA-binding polypeptide (TBP) subunit and the presence of TBP dimers in vivo further support the interaction between TFIID and TAF(II)250 proteins.</s>

For unknown reasons, the eukaryotic transcription factor TFIID inefficiently recognizes promoters. Human TFIID was found to form highly specific homodimers that must dissociate before DNA binding. TFIID dimers formed through self-association of the TATA-binding polypeptide (TBP) subunit and could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to TAF(II)250, the core subunit of TFIID. Chemical cross-linking experiments in HeLa cells revealed the presence of TBP dimers in vivo.

We have recently shown that the IkappaB protein IkappaBbeta interacted with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and inhibited the 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA)-dependent transactivations (Na, S.-Y., Kim, H.-J., Lee, S.-K., Choi, H.-S., Na, D. S., Lee, M.-O., Chung, M., Moore, D. D., and Lee, J. W. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 6, 3212-3215). Herein, we show that a distinct IkappaB protein Bcl3 also interacts with RXR, as shown in the yeast two-hybrid tests and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. The Bcl3 interaction involved two distinct subregions of RXR, i.e. constitutive interactions of the N-terminal ABC domains and 9-cis-RA-dependent interactions of the C-terminal DEF domains. In contrast to IkappaBbeta, Bcl3 did not interact with the AF2 domain of RXR. Bcl3 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIA but not with TFIIEalpha in the GST pull-down assays. TBP and TFIIA, however, were not able to interact with IkappaBbeta. Accordingly, Bcl3 coactivated the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR, in contrast to the inhibitory actions of IkappaBbeta. In addition, coexpression of SRC-1 but not p300 further stimulated the Bcl3-mediated enhancement of the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR. These results suggest that distinct IkappaB proteins differentially modulate the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR in vivo.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Bcl3 protein] and [TFIIB protein] interact with each other?
