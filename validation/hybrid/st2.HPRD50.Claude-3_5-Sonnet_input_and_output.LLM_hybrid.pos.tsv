HPRD50.d1 HPRD50.d1.s0.e0 HPRD50.d1.s0.e1	monocyte chemotactic protein-1	CCR2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 10529171 Identification of residues in the monocyte chemotactic protein-1 that contact the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2. The CC chemokine, MCP-1, has been identified as a major chemoattractant for T cells and monocytes, and plays a significant role in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. To identify the regions of MCP-1 that contact its receptor, CCR2, we substituted all surface-exposed residues with alanine. Some residues were also mutated to other amino acids to identify the importance of charge, hydrophobicity, or aromaticity at specific positions. The binding affinity of each mutant for CCR2 was assayed with THP-1 and CCR2-transfected CHL cells. The majority of point mutations had no effect. Residues at the N-terminus of the protein, known to be crucial for signaling, contribute less than a factor of 10 to the binding affinity. However, two clusters of primarily basic residues (R24, K35, K38, K49, and Y13), separated by a 35 A hydrophobic groove, reduced the level of binding by 15-100-fold. A peptide fragment encompassing residues 13-35 recapitulated some of the mutational data derived from the intact protein. It exhibited modest binding as a linear peptide and dramatically improved affinity when the region which adopts a single turn of a 3(10)-helix in the protein, which includes R24, was constrained by a disulfide bond. Additional constraints at the ends of the peptide, corresponding to the disulfide between the first and third cysteines in MCP-1, yielded further improvements in affinity. Together, these data suggest a model in which a large surface area of MCP-1 contacts the receptor, and the accumulation of a number of weak interactions results in the 35 pM affinity observed for the wild-type (WT) protein. The receptor binding site of MCP-1 also is significantly different from the binding sites of RANTES and IL-8, providing insight into the issue of receptor specificity. It was previously shown that the N-terminus of CCR2 is critical for binding MCP-1 [Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19084-92; Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 23186-90]. Point mutations of six acidic residues in this region of the receptor were made to test their role in ligand binding. This identified D25 and D27 of the DYDY motif as being important. On the basis of our data, we propose a model in which the receptor N-terminus lies along the hydrophobic groove in an extended fashion, placing the DYDY motif near the basic cluster involving R24 and K49 of MCP-1. This in turn orients the signaling residues (Y13 and the N-terminus) for productive interaction with the receptor.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [monocyte chemotactic protein-1 protein] and [CCR2 protein] interact with each other?

Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal.

Explanation: The provided context clearly indicates that monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and CCR2 interact with each other. Specifically:  1. The study aims to identify "residues in the monocyte chemotactic protein-1 that contact the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2."  2. The researchers conducted binding affinity assays of MCP-1 mutants for CCR2, indicating a direct interaction between these two proteins.  3. The study identifies specific residues in MCP-1 (R24, K35, K38, K49, and Y13) that are important for binding to CCR2.  4. The context mentions that MCP-1 has a "35 pM affinity" for CCR2, further confirming their interaction.  5. The researchers propose a model where "a large surface area of MCP-1 contacts the receptor."  6. The study also investigates the N-terminus of CCR2, identifying specific residues (D25 and D27) that are important for binding MCP-1.  7. The researchers propose a model of interaction where "the receptor N-terminus lies along the hydrophobic groove" of MCP-1.  These points provide strong evidence that monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and CCR2 directly interact with each other, justifying a high confidence in this conclusion.

BACKGROUND: A number of recent studies have identified interleukin (IL)-6 as an important regulator of prostate cancer growth. Here, we investigate the potential interaction of IL-6 with phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase, a key growth regulatory enzyme, in prostate cancer cell lines. METHODS: Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase, in the human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 was assessed by sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-p85 antibody and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. The effects of wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI-3 kinase, and/or IL-6 on cell growth were assessed by MTT assays. DNA laddering experiments were performed to assay for programmed cell death. RESULTS: Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 is upregulated by IL-6 in both LNCaP and PC-3. IL-6 promotes coprecipitation of p85 with gp130, the signal-transducing component of the IL-6 receptor. Inhibition of PI-3 kinase with wortmannin induces programmed cell death in PC-3 cells. In contrast, wortmannin has no effect on LNCaP growth when used alone; however, combined with IL-6, wortmannin promotes apoptosis in these cells.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is strong evidence that Interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) protein interact with each other. The key points supporting this interaction are:  1. The study investigates the "potential interaction of IL-6 with phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase" in prostate cancer cell lines.  2. IL-6 is shown to upregulate tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, which is the regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase, in both LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines.  3. IL-6 promotes coprecipitation of p85 with gp130, which is the signal-transducing component of the IL-6 receptor. This suggests a direct link between IL-6 signaling and PI-3 kinase activation.  4. The study concludes that "PI-3 kinase is involved in IL-6 signal transduction and delivers an antiapoptotic signal in human prostate cancer cell lines."  These findings clearly demonstrate that IL-6 activates PI-3 kinase through a signaling cascade, indicating a functional interaction between the two proteins. The high confidence in this interaction is supported by the multiple experimental approaches used (immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, cell growth assays, and DNA laddering experiments) and the consistent results observed across different cell lines.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence of interaction between IL-6 protein and gp130 protein. The key information supporting this interaction is:  "IL-6 promotes coprecipitation of p85 with gp130, the signal-transducing component of the IL-6 receptor."  This statement indicates that IL-6 facilitates the association between p85 (a subunit of PI-3 kinase) and gp130, which is described as part of the IL-6 receptor. This suggests that IL-6 and gp130 are interacting as part of the signaling process.  Additionally, the context mentions that IL-6 is involved in signal transduction and affects PI-3 kinase activity, which further supports the interaction between IL-6 and its receptor component, gp130.  The confidence is rated as medium because while there is clear evidence of a functional relationship between IL-6 and gp130, the interaction is not described in great detail, and the study focuses more on the downstream effects of IL-6 signaling rather than the specific interaction between IL-6 and gp130.

This statement directly indicates that the extracellular domain of FGFR4 (FGFR4ed) binds to FGF-8, which implies an interaction between these two proteins.   The confidence level is rated as medium because:  1. The interaction is explicitly mentioned, providing direct evidence. 2. However, the study primarily focused on FGF-1 and FGF-2, with FGF-8 being mentioned only briefly. 3. The context doesn't provide detailed information about the nature or strength of the FGFR4-FGF-8 interaction compared to the other FGFs. 4. The study was conducted using a recombinant extracellular domain of FGFR4, which may not fully represent the behavior of the full-length receptor in a cellular context.  While the interaction is clearly stated, more detailed information about the FGFR4-FGF-8 interaction would be needed to increase the confidence level to high.

This interaction is demonstrated through multiple experimental methods:  1. Covalent crosslinking experiments: The text states that "Pure FGFR4ed was tested for FGF- and heparin-binding by covalent crosslinking experiments."  2.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence   Explanation: The context provides clear evidence of interaction between FGFR4 protein (represented by FGFR4ed, which is the extracellular domain of FGFR4) and FGF-2 protein (also referred to as basic FGF in the text). Specifically:  1. The text states that "Pure FGFR4ed was tested for FGF- and heparin-binding by covalent crosslinking experiments and by biosensor analysis."  2. It further mentions that "In solution, FGFR4ed formed complexes with acidic FGF (FGF-1) and basic FGF (FGF-2), both in the presence and absence of heparin."  3. Additionally, it notes that "Immobilized FGFR4 also bound FGF-8 besides FGF-1 and FGF-2."  These statements clearly demonstrate that FGFR4 protein (represented by its extracellular domain) directly interacts with FGF-2 protein by forming complexes and binding to it. This interaction occurs both in solution and when FGFR4 is immobilized, and it happens both in the presence and absence of heparin. The direct observation of complex formation and binding provides strong evidence for the interaction between these two proteins, hence the high confidence in this assessment.

Intracellular signaling pathways, which regulate the interactions of integrins with their ligands, affect a wide variety of biological functions. Here we provide evidence of how cytohesin-1, an integrin-binding protein and guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF GTPases, regulates cell adhesion. Mutational analyses of the beta-2 cytoplasmic domain revealed that the adhesive function of LFA-1 depends on its interaction with cytohesin-1, unless the integrin is activated by exogenous divalent cations. Secondly, cytohesin-1 induces expression of an extracellular activation epitope of LFA-1, and the exchange factor function is not essential for this activity. In contrast, LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 is strongly inhibited by a cytohesin-1 mutant, which fails to catalyze ARF GDP-GTP exchange in vitro. Thus, cytohesin-1 is involved in the activation of LFA-1, most probably through direct interaction with the integrin, and induces cell spreading by its ARF-GEF activity.

Explanation: The context provided clearly indicates that Cytohesin-1 protein and LFA-1 protein interact with each other. Several pieces of evidence support this interaction:  1.

The text proposes that "direct regulation of the integrin [LFA-1] and concomitant changes in the membrane topology of adherent T cells are modulated by dissectable functions of cytohesin-1," further emphasizing their interaction.  These multiple references to the interaction between Cytohesin-1 and LFA-1 provide strong evidence for their interaction, justifying a high confidence level in this assessment.

The context provides strong evidence that cytohesin-1 protein and ARF protein interact with each other. Here's the explanation:  1. The passage explicitly states that cytohesin-1 is a "guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF GTPases." This indicates a direct functional interaction between cytohesin-1 and ARF proteins.  2. The text mentions that cytohesin-1's ARF-GEF activity is crucial for its function in cell adhesion and spreading.

The conclusion of the passage reinforces this interaction by stating that cytohesin-1 "induces cell spreading by its ARF-GEF activity."  These points clearly demonstrate that cytohesin-1 protein and ARF protein interact functionally, with cytohesin-1 acting as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for ARF GTPases. This interaction is central to the regulatory role of cytohesin-1 in cell adhesion and spreading processes.

We have studied the transcription regulation of the rat thromboxane synthase (TXS) gene by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in macrophages. The transcription activity of a cloned 5'-flanking region (1.6 kilobases) of the rat TXS gene (5'FL-TXS) was examined by luciferase reporter gene assay. TXS mRNA expression and the transcription activity of 5'FL-TXS were inhibited by PPARgamma ligands, 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (PGJ(2)), and the thiazolidinedione troglitazone (TRO) in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of PPARgamma also significantly suppressed transcription, and further addition of PGJ(2) or TRO augmented the suppression. Deletion analysis showed that the element responsible for the PPARgamma effect is located in a region containing the nuclear factor E2 (NF-E2)/AP-1 site (-98/-88), which was indicated to be the major promoter of the TXS gene. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the NF-E2/AP-1 site and nuclear extracts from macrophages, we observed a specific protein-DNA complex formation, which was inhibited by a specific antibody against the transcription factor NRF2 (NF-E2-related factor 2). Moreover, the complex was decreased with PGJ(2), TRO, or in vitro translated PPARgamma. The transcription suppression by PPARgamma was confirmed using this truncated NRF2-binding element (-98/-88) by the reporter gene assay. Finally, a direct interaction between PPARgamma and NRF2 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay. In conclusion, the NRF2-binding site (-98/-88) is the major promoter of 5'FL-TXS which can be suppressed by activated PPARgamma via a protein-protein interaction with NRF2 in macrophages.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma protein] and [NRF2 protein] interact with each other?

The evidence for this interaction is clearly stated in the text:  1. The study found that PPARgamma suppressed the transcription activity of the thromboxane synthase (TXS) gene through an element containing the NF-E2/AP-1 site, which is bound by NRF2.  2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PPARgamma inhibited the formation of a protein-DNA complex involving NRF2 at the NF-E2/AP-1 site.  3. The transcription suppression by PPARgamma was confirmed using the truncated NRF2-binding element.  4. Most importantly, the text explicitly states: "Finally, a direct interaction between PPARgamma and NRF2 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay."  This last point provides direct experimental evidence of a physical interaction between PPARgamma and NRF2 proteins, supporting a high confidence conclusion that these two proteins interact with each other in the context of regulating TXS gene transcription in macrophages.

ADAM 12, a member of the ADAM family of transmembrane metalloprotease-disintegrins, has been implicated previously in the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts. In the present study, we show that the cytoplasmic tail of mouse ADAM 12 interacts in vitro and in vivo with the Src homology 3 domain of the p85alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified three p85alpha-binding sites in ADAM 12 involving PXXP motifs located at amino acids 825-828, 833-836, and 884-887. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-pleckstrin homology (PH) domain fusion protein as a probe for PI 3-kinase lipid products, we have further demonstrated that expression of ADAM 12 in C2C12 cells resulted in translocation of GFP-PH to the plasma membrane. This suggests that transmembrane ADAM 12, by providing docking sites for the Src homology 3 domain of p85alpha, activates PI 3-kinase by mediating its recruitment to the membrane. Because PI 3-kinase is critical for terminal differentiation of myoblasts, and because expression of ADAM 12 is up-regulated at the onset of the differentiation process, ADAM 12-mediated activation may constitute one of the regulatory mechanisms for PI 3-kinase during myoblast differentiation.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [ADAM 12 protein] and [p85alpha protein] interact with each other?

In the present study, we show that the cytoplasmic tail of mouse ADAM 12 interacts in vitro and in vivo with the Src homology 3 domain of the p85alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified three p85alpha-binding sites in ADAM 12 involving PXXP motifs located at amino acids 825-828, 833-836, and 884-887. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-pleckstrin homology (PH) domain fusion protein as a probe for PI 3-kinase lipid products, we have further demonstrated that expression of ADAM 12 in C2C12 cells resulted in translocation of GFP-PH to the plasma membrane. This suggests that transmembrane ADAM 12, by providing docking sites for the Src homology 3 domain of p85alpha, activates PI 3-kinase by mediating its recruitment to the membrane. Because PI 3-kinase is critical for terminal differentiation of myoblasts, and because expression of ADAM 12 is up-regulated at the onset of the differentiation process, ADAM 12-mediated activation may constitute one of the regulatory mechanisms for PI 3-kinase during myoblast differentiation.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [ADAM 12 protein] and [p85alpha protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence.  The context provides strong evidence that ADAM 12 protein and p85alpha protein directly interact with each other. Here are the key points supporting this interaction:  1. The study explicitly states that "the cytoplasmic tail of mouse ADAM 12 interacts in vitro and in vivo with the Src homology 3 domain of the p85alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase."  2. The researchers identified three specific p85alpha-binding sites in ADAM 12, involving PXXP motifs at amino acids 825-828, 833-836, and 884-887.  3. The interaction between ADAM 12 and p85alpha leads to the activation of PI 3-kinase by mediating its recruitment to the membrane.  4. This interaction is suggested to play a role in the regulation of PI 3-kinase during myoblast differentiation.  The direct physical interaction between these two proteins is clearly described and experimentally demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo. This evidence strongly supports a high-confidence conclusion that ADAM 12 protein and p85alpha protein interact with each other.

CLIP-170 is a plus-end tracking protein which may act as an anticatastrophe factor. It has been proposed to mediate the association of dynein/dynactin to microtubule (MT) plus ends, and it also binds to kinetochores in a dynein/dynactin-dependent fashion, both via its C-terminal domain. This domain contains two zinc finger motifs (proximal and distal), which are hypothesized to mediate protein-protein interactions. LIS1, a protein implicated in brain development, acts in several processes mediated by the dynein/dynactin pathway by interacting with dynein and other proteins. Here we demonstrate colocalization and direct interaction between CLIP-170 and LIS1. In mammalian cells, LIS1 recruitment to kinetochores is dynein/dynactin dependent, and recruitment there of CLIP-170 is dependent on its site of binding to LIS1, located in the distal zinc finger motif. Overexpression of CLIP-170 results in a zinc finger-dependent localization of a phospho-LIS1 isoform and dynactin to MT bundles, raising the possibility that CLIP-170 and LIS1 regulate dynein/dynactin binding to MTs. This work suggests that LIS1 is a regulated adapter between CLIP-170 and cytoplasmic dynein at sites involved in cargo-MT loading, and/or in the control of MT dynamics.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CLIP-170 protein] and [LIS1 protein] interact with each other?

The receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP1, also known as CD148, is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells, in a variety of tumor cell lines, and in lymphocytes. Expression of DEP1 is enhanced at high cell density, and this observation suggests that DEP1 may function in the regulation of cell adhesion and possibly contact inhibition of cell growth. In order to investigate the function of DEP1, substrate-trapping mutants of the phosphatase were used to identify potential substrates. GST-fusion proteins containing the DEP1 catalytic domain with a substrate-trapping D/A mutation were found to interact with p120(ctn), a component of adherens junctions. DEP1 also interacted with other members of the catenin gene family including beta-catenin and gamma-catenin. The interaction with p120(ctn) is likely to be direct, as the interaction occurs in K562 cells lacking functional adherens junctions and E-cadherin expression. Catalytic domains of the tyrosine phosphatases PTP-PEST, CD45, and PTPbeta did not interact with proteins of the catenin family to detectable levels, suggesting that the interaction of DEP1 with these proteins is specific. DEP1 expression was concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact in A549 cells. p120(ctn) was found to colocalize with these structures.

The context clearly states that DEP1 and p120(ctn) proteins interact with each other. Several pieces of evidence support this interaction:  1. The title of the study directly mentions the interaction: "The transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP1 interacts with p120(ctn)."  2. The study used substrate-trapping mutants of DEP1 to identify potential substrates, and found that "GST-fusion proteins containing the DEP1 catalytic domain with a substrate-trapping D/A mutation were found to interact with p120(ctn)."  3. The interaction is described as likely to be direct, as it occurs even in cells lacking functional adherens junctions and E-cadherin expression.  4. The specificity of the interaction is highlighted by the fact that other tyrosine phosphatases (PTP-PEST, CD45, and PTPbeta) did not interact with proteins of the catenin family to detectable levels.  5.

DEP1 also interacted with other members of the catenin gene family including beta-catenin and gamma-catenin."  This directly indicates that DEP1 interacts with beta-catenin. However, the confidence level is medium because:  1. The interaction is mentioned briefly without extensive details about the nature or strength of the interaction. 2. The main focus of the passage is on the interaction between DEP1 and p120(ctn), with beta-catenin mentioned as an additional interaction. 3. The study primarily used substrate-trapping mutants to identify potential substrates, which might not fully represent the physiological interaction.

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and members of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family are involved in the regulation of muscle-specific gene expression during myogenesis. Physical interaction between these two factors is required to synergistically activate gene transcription. p300/cAMP-response-element-binding-protein ('CREB')-binding protein (CBP) interacting with transcription factors is able to increase their activity on target gene promoters. We investigated the role of p300 in regulating the TR-MEF2A complex. To this end, we mapped the regions of these proteins involved in physical interactions and we evaluated the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in U2OS cells under control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter containing the thyroid hormone response element (TRE). Our results suggested a role of p300/CBP in mediating the transactivation effects of the TR-retenoid X receptor (RxR)-MEF2A complex. Our findings showed that the same C-terminal portion of p300 binds the N-terminal domains of both TR and MEF2A, and our in vivo studies demonstrated that TR, MEF2A and p300 form a ternary complex. Moreover, by the use of CAT assays, we demonstrated that adenovirus E1A inhibits activation of transcription by TR-RxR-MEF2A-p300 but not by TR-RxR-MEF2A. Our data suggested that p300 can bind and modulate the activity of TR-RxR-MEF2A at TRE.

The context discusses how p300 can "bind and modulate the activity of TR-RxR-MEF2A at TRE," further supporting the interaction between p300 and MEF2A.  These points provide strong evidence for a direct physical interaction between p300 protein and MEF2A protein, as well as their functional interaction in regulating gene transcription. Therefore, we can conclude with high confidence that these two proteins interact with each other.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between cAMP-response-element-binding-protein (CREB) and MEF2A protein. The text primarily focuses on the interactions between p300/CBP, thyroid hormone receptor (TR), retinoid X receptor (RxR), and MEF2A.  The context mentions CREB only as part of the full name of CBP (CREB-binding protein), which is part of the p300/CBP complex. However, it does not describe any specific interaction between CREB itself and MEF2A.  The text describes interactions between: 1. p300/CBP and MEF2A 2. p300/CBP and TR 3. TR and MEF2A 4. Formation of a ternary complex between TR, MEF2A, and p300  While these interactions are clearly described, there is no mention of CREB protein directly interacting with MEF2A. The medium confidence level is assigned because while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, it's possible that such an interaction might exist but is not mentioned in this specific text.

HPRD50.d20 HPRD50.d20.s0.e0 HPRD50.d20.s0.e1	Imp3	Imp4	[INST]Context: [PMID: 12655004 The human Imp3 and Imp4 proteins form a ternary complex with hMpp10, which only interacts with the U3 snoRNA in 60-80S ribonucleoprotein complexes. Ribosome biogenesis requires a vast number of trans-acting factors many of which are required for the chemical modification and processing of the pre-rRNA component. The U3 snoRNP complex is required for the early cleavage steps in pre-rRNA processing. We have cloned cDNAs encoding the human and mouse homologs of the yeast U3 snoRNP-associated proteins Imp3 and Imp4. Both human proteins localize to nucleoli and interact with the U3 snoRNA. The results of complementation experiments show that, in contrast to mouse Imp4, mouse Imp3 can partially alleviate the growth defect of the corresponding yeast null strain, indicating that the role of Imp3 in pre-rRNA processing is evolutionarily conserved. The results of density gradient centrifugation experiments show that, in contrast to hU3-55K, the human Imp3 and Imp4 proteins predominantly interact with the U3 snoRNA in 60-80S ribonucleoprotein complexes. In addition, we have found that hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 can form a stable hetero-trimeric complex in vitro, which is generated by direct interactions of both hImp3 and hImp4 with hMpp10. The analysis of hImp3 and hImp4 mutants indicated that their binding to hMpp10 correlates with their nucleolar accumulation, strongly suggesting that the formation of the ternary complex of hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 is required for their association with nucleolar components.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Imp3 protein] and [Imp4 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: The context suggests that the Imp3 and Imp4 proteins interact indirectly through their association with hMpp10 to form a ternary complex. Specifically, the text states:  "hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 can form a stable hetero-trimeric complex in vitro, which is generated by direct interactions of both hImp3 and hImp4 with hMpp10."  This indicates that while Imp3 and Imp4 do not directly interact with each other, they do form a complex together with hMpp10. This indirect interaction through a shared partner protein suggests a functional relationship between Imp3 and Imp4.  The confidence level is medium because while the formation of the ternary complex is clearly stated, a direct interaction between Imp3 and Imp4 is not explicitly mentioned. The interaction is inferred from their joint participation in the same complex and their shared interaction with hMpp10.

In the present study, we observed evidence of cross-talk between the cannabinoid receptor CB1 and the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) using a heterologous system. When the two receptors are co-expressed, we observed a major CB1-dependent enhancement of the orexin A potency to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway; dose-responses curves indicated a 100-fold increase in the potency of orexin-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. This effect required a functional CB1 receptor as evidenced by the blockade of the orexin response by the specific CB1 antagonist, N-(piperidino-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716), but also by pertussis toxin, suggesting that this potentiation is Gi-mediated. In contrast to OX1R, the potency of direct activation of CB1 was not affected by co-expression with OX1R. In addition, electron microscopy experiments revealed that CB1 and OX1R are closely apposed at the plasma membrane level; they are close enough to form hetero-oligomers. Altogether, for the first time our data provide evidence that CB1 is able to potentiate an orexigenic receptor. Considering the antiobesity effect of SR141716, these results open new avenues to understand the mechanism by which the molecule may prevent weight gain through functional interaction between CB1 and other receptors involved in the control of appetite.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CB1 protein] and [orexin 1 receptor protein] interact with each other?

The context provides strong evidence of interaction between the CB1 protein (cannabinoid receptor CB1) and the orexin 1 receptor protein (OX1R). Key points supporting this interaction include:  1. Cross-talk: The study observes evidence of cross-talk between CB1 and OX1R when co-expressed.  2. Enhanced potency: CB1 presence significantly enhances the potency of orexin A to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway through OX1R, indicating a 100-fold increase in potency.  3. Functional dependence: The enhanced orexin response requires a functional CB1 receptor, as demonstrated by the blockade of the effect using a specific CB1 antagonist (SR141716).  4. Close physical proximity: Electron microscopy reveals that CB1 and OX1R are closely apposed at the plasma membrane level, suggesting they are close enough to form hetero-oligomers.  5. Unidirectional effect: While CB1 potentiates OX1R activity, the reverse is not observed (OX1R does not affect CB1 activation).  These observations strongly indicate a functional interaction between CB1 and OX1R proteins, with CB1 significantly modulating OX1R activity. This interaction appears to be both functional and potentially physical, given their close proximity at the membrane level.

Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Crk. To identify new binding partners for GAB proteins and better understand their functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with hGab2-(120-587) as bait. This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases. The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned CdGAP and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro. The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42. GC-GAP is predominantly expressed in the brain with low levels detected in other tissues. Antibodies directed against GC-GAP recognized a protein of approximately 200 kDa. Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA. Suppression of GC-GAP expression by siRNA inhibited proliferation of C6 astroglioma cells. In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro. We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities. Given that GC-GAP is specifically expressed in the nervous system and that it is localized to the dendritic processes of cultured neurons, GC-GAP may play a role in dendritic morphogenesis and also possibly in neural/glial cell proliferation.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GC-GAP protein] and [Gab1 protein] interact with each other?

The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins (including Gab1 and Gab2).  3. The authors propose that "Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli."  These statements provide strong evidence for a direct interaction between GC-GAP and Gab1 proteins. The interaction is described as a key feature of GC-GAP's function and cellular regulation, supporting a high confidence level in this interaction.

Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Crk. To identify new binding partners for GAB proteins and better understand their functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with hGab2-(120-587) as bait. This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases. The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned CdGAP and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro. The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42. GC-GAP is predominantly expressed in the brain with low levels detected in other tissues. Antibodies directed against GC-GAP recognized a protein of approximately 200 kDa. Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA. Suppression of GC-GAP expression by siRNA inhibited proliferation of C6 astroglioma cells. In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro. We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities. Given that GC-GAP is specifically expressed in the nervous system and that it is localized to the dendritic processes of cultured neurons, GC-GAP may play a role in dendritic morphogenesis and also possibly in neural/glial cell proliferation.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GC-GAP protein] and [Gab2 protein] interact with each other?

The context mentions that "Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Crk."  This statement indicates that Gab proteins, including Gab1, interact with several signaling proteins, and Grb2 is specifically mentioned as one of these interacting partners. While the nature of this interaction is not detailed, it suggests that Gab1 and Grb2 are part of the same signaling complex and likely have some form of functional interaction.  The confidence level is medium because: 1. The interaction is not explicitly described as a direct physical interaction. 2. The context is focused on identifying new binding partners for GAB proteins, rather than specifically studying the Gab1-Grb2 interaction. 3. The interaction is mentioned as part of a list of several interacting proteins, without providing specific details about the Gab1-Grb2 interaction.  However, given that Grb2 is explicitly mentioned as one of the interacting partners of Gab proteins, there is a reasonable basis to conclude that Gab1 and Grb2 do interact in some capacity within cellular signaling pathways.

The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned CdGAP and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro. The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42. GC-GAP is predominantly expressed in the brain with low levels detected in other tissues. Antibodies directed against GC-GAP recognized a protein of approximately 200 kDa. Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA. Suppression of GC-GAP expression by siRNA inhibited proliferation of C6 astroglioma cells. In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro. We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities. Given that GC-GAP is specifically expressed in the nervous system and that it is localized to the dendritic processes of cultured neurons, GC-GAP may play a role in dendritic morphogenesis and also possibly in neural/glial cell proliferation.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Gab1 protein] and [GC-GAP protein] interact with each other?

This interaction is explicitly mentioned in the following sentences:  1. "To identify new binding partners for GAB proteins and better understand their functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with hGab2-(120-587) as bait. This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases."  2.

The confidence level is medium because while the interaction is explicitly stated, the context doesn't provide detailed information about the specific nature or strength of the interaction between GC-GAP and Gab1 individually, as most references are to Gab proteins in general or to both Gab1 and Gab2.

Explanation: The context provides evidence of an interaction between GC-GAP protein and Rac1 protein, although it's not explicitly stated as a direct physical interaction. The following points support this conclusion:  1. GC-GAP is described as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases, which includes Rac1.  2. The text states that GC-GAP "displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro," indicating a functional interaction between GC-GAP and Rac1.  3. Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 levels, demonstrating that GC-GAP affects Rac1 activity in a cellular context.  These points suggest that GC-GAP and Rac1 interact functionally, with GC-GAP regulating Rac1's activity. However, the confidence level is medium because:  1. The interaction is not described as a direct physical binding. 2. The study focuses more on GC-GAP's interactions with Gab proteins and its overall function rather than specifically on its relationship with Rac1. 3. The interaction is inferred from functional effects rather than being directly observed or measured.  Given these factors, we can conclude that GC-GAP and Rac1 do interact, but with medium confidence due to the indirect nature of the evidence provided in the context.

The functional importance of this interaction is demonstrated by the fact that mutations in the Plk1 phosphorylation sites of NudC prevent the rescue of mitotic defects caused by NudC downregulation.  These points clearly indicate a direct physical interaction (binding) and a functional interaction (phosphorylation) between Plk1 and NudC proteins. The interaction is well-characterized and appears to play a significant role in cytokinesis, supporting a high confidence assessment of their interaction.

Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) plays essential roles at multiple events during cell division, yet little is known about its physiological substrates. In a cDNA phage display screen using Plk1 C-terminal affinity columns, we identified NudC (nuclear distribution gene C) as a Plk1 binding protein. Here, we characterize the interaction between Plk1 and NudC, show that Plk1 phosphorylates NudC at conserved S274 and S326 residues in vitro, and present evidence that NudC is also a substrate for Plk1 in vivo. Downregulation of NudC by RNA interference results in multiple mitotic defects, including multinucleation and cells arrested at the midbody stage, which are rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type NudC, but not by NudC with mutations in the Plk1 phosphorylation sites.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence  The context provides strong evidence that NudC protein and Plk1 protein interact with each other. Here's the explanation:  1. Direct binding: The passage states that "NudC (nuclear distribution gene C) [was identified] as a Plk1 binding protein" in a cDNA phage display screen. This indicates a physical interaction between the two proteins.  2. Phosphorylation: The context mentions that "Plk1 phosphorylates NudC at conserved S274 and S326 residues in vitro" and presents evidence that "NudC is also a substrate for Plk1 in vivo." Phosphorylation is a clear indication of protein-protein interaction.  3. Functional relationship: The study shows that mutations in the Plk1 phosphorylation sites of NudC affect its ability to rescue mitotic defects caused by NudC downregulation. This suggests that the interaction between Plk1 and NudC is functionally significant.  4. Biological relevance: The context concludes that "Plk1 phosphorylation of NudC may influence cytokinesis," indicating that the interaction between these two proteins has important biological consequences.  Given these multiple lines of evidence for both physical and functional interactions between NudC and Plk1 proteins, we can conclude with high confidence that these two proteins interact with each other.

HPRD50.d24 HPRD50.d24.s1.e2 HPRD50.d24.s1.e3	oncostatin M	LDLR	[INST]Context: [PMID: 12947119 Specific interaction of Egr1 and c/EBPbeta leads to the transcriptional activation of the human low density lipoprotein receptor gene. The sterol-independent regulatory element (SIRE) of the LDL receptor (LDLR) promoter mediates oncostatin M (OM)-induced transcription of the LDLR gene through a cholesterol-independent pathway. Our prior studies have detected specific associations of the zinc finger transcription factor Egr1 with the SIRE sequence in OM-stimulated HepG2 cells. Because the SIRE motif is composed of a c/EBP binding site and a cAMP response element, both of which are quite divergent from the classical GC-rich Egr1 recognition sequences, we hypothesized that Egr1 may regulate LDLR transcription through interacting with members of the c/EBP and CREB families. Here, we show that treating HepG2 cells with OM specifically leads to prominent increases of the levels of c/EBPbeta and Egr1 bound to the LDLR promoter in vivo. In vitro, the binding of Egr1 to the SIRE sequence is weak, but is strikingly enhanced in the presence of HepG2 nuclear extract. Mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrate that the N-terminal transactivation domain of Egr1 specifically interacts with c/EBPbeta but not with c/EBPalpha or CREB. The OM treatment further enhances this interaction, resulting in a large increase in the Egr1 transactivating activity. The direct protein to protein contact between Egr1 and c/EBPbeta is also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, we show that a mutation of the phosphorylation motif of c/EBPbeta diminished the OM-stimulated interaction of Egr1 and c/EBPbeta. Taken together, we provide strong evidence that Egr1 regulates LDLR transcription via a novel mechanism of protein-protein interaction with c/EBPbeta.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [oncostatin M protein] and [LDLR protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence to suggest that oncostatin M (OM) protein and LDLR protein interact indirectly through a regulatory pathway. The context states that:  1. Oncostatin M (OM) induces transcription of the LDLR gene through a cholesterol-independent pathway. 2. OM stimulates the binding of Egr1 and c/EBPbeta to the LDLR promoter. 3. OM treatment enhances the interaction between Egr1 and c/EBPbeta, leading to increased Egr1 transactivating activity. 4. This interaction results in the transcriptional activation of the LDLR gene.  While there is no direct physical interaction mentioned between oncostatin M protein and LDLR protein, the context clearly indicates that oncostatin M influences the expression and regulation of LDLR through a signaling cascade involving Egr1 and c/EBPbeta. This regulatory relationship can be considered a form of indirect interaction between the two proteins.  The confidence level is medium because the interaction is indirect and mediated through other factors, rather than being a direct physical interaction between the two proteins. However, the evidence for this regulatory relationship is strong within the given context.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence suggesting that TBP-1 protein and Hif1 alpha protein interact with each other, albeit indirectly through their association with pVHL. The following points support this interaction:  1. The context states that "TBP-1 associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and Hif1 alpha in vivo." This suggests that TBP-1 and Hif1 alpha are part of the same protein complex in living cells.  2. Overexpression of TBP-1 is reported to promote the degradation of Hif1 alpha in a pVHL-dependent manner. This indicates a functional relationship between TBP-1 and Hif1 alpha, mediated by pVHL.  3. When TBP-1 expression is blocked using siRNA, the degradation kinetics of Hif1 alpha are prolonged. This further supports the idea that TBP-1 plays a role in regulating Hif1 alpha levels.  4. The context mentions that a pVHL mutant (P154L) that can't bind to TBP-1 also fails to promote Hif1 alpha degradation, suggesting that the interaction between TBP-1 and pVHL is crucial for Hif1 alpha regulation.  While these points strongly suggest an interaction between TBP-1 and Hif1 alpha, the interaction appears to be indirect and mediated through pVHL. The context does not explicitly state a direct physical interaction between TBP-1 and Hif1 alpha. Therefore, I've assigned a medium confidence level to this interaction.

It is mentioned that "TBP-1 associates with the beta-domain of pVHL," further specifying the nature of their interaction.  3. The context describes that "TBP-1 complexes with pVHL and Hif1 alpha in vivo," indicating that these proteins form a complex together in living cells.  4. The functionality of this interaction is demonstrated by the fact that "Overexpression of TBP-1 promotes degradation of Hif1 alpha in a pVHL-dependent manner."  5. The importance of this interaction is highlighted by the observation that "Several distinct mutations in exon 2 of VHL disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP-1," and a specific mutation (P154L) in pVHL prevents its interaction with TBP-1 and impairs its ability to degrade Hif1 alpha.  These points provide strong evidence for a direct and functionally significant interaction between pVHL protein and TBP-1 protein, supporting a high confidence assessment of their interaction.

PURPOSE: Pinin (Pnn/DRS/memA) is a cell-adhesion-related and nuclear protein that has been identified as central in the establishment and maintenance of corneal epithelial cell-cell adhesion. To begin the elucidation of the role of Pnn within the nucleus of corneal epithelial cells, this study was undertaken to identify the proteins that bind to Pnn. METHODS: Yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed. A human cDNA library in the pGAD-10 vector and C-terminal region of human Pnn (465-717) in a pAS2-1 vector were cotransformed into the PJ69-4A yeast strain, containing the lacZ, HIS3, and ADE2 reporter genes. To dissect domains of Pnn responsible for mediating the interaction with the identified proteins, PNN fragments were ligated with the DNA-binding domain of the pAS2-1 vector. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-T, RCB1384) and HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with mammalian expression vectors containing Pnn with identified interacting partners and subsequently immunostained and immunoblotted to determine expressed and endogenous proteins. RESULTS: Pnn colocalized and copurified with serine-arginine (SR) proteins. Three SR-rich proteins were identified that interact with the C-terminus of Pnn: SRp75 and SRm300, known components of spliceosome machinery, and a novel 130-kDa nuclear protein, SRrp130. All of these proteins colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with one another and exhibited speckled nuclear distribution that aligned with components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. The cDNA for SRrp130 encoded a protein of 805 amino acid residues and contained multiple arginine-serine (RS) repeats but had no RNA recognition motif. Analysis of the Pnn motifs using two-hybrid system assays demonstrated that the polyserine/RS motif within Pnn plays a central but not exclusive role in mediating molecular interactions with identified SR-rich proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Pnn and SR-rich proteins may be part of a multiprotein complex within the nucleus and may be involved in pre-mRNA processing.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Pinin protein] and [SRp75 protein] interact with each other?

The study used multiple methods to confirm these interactions, including yeast two-hybrid analyses, co-transfection experiments, immunostaining, and immunoblotting.  Given this direct and multiple lines of evidence for the interaction between Pinin and SRp75, we can conclude with high confidence that these two proteins interact with each other in the context of corneal epithelial cells and potentially in other cellular environments where they are co-expressed.

This statement directly confirms the interaction between Dnmt3a and Ubc9 proteins. The interaction is described in the context of the sumoylation process, where Ubc9 is involved in conjugating SUMO-1 to target proteins, including Dnmt3a.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence to suggest that Dnmt3a protein and PIAS1 protein interact with each other. The passage states that "Dnmt3a interacts with multiple components of the sumoylation machinery, namely the E2 sumo conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and the E3 sumo ligases PIAS1 and PIASxalpha." This directly indicates an interaction between Dnmt3a and PIAS1.  The confidence is rated as medium because:  1. The interaction is explicitly mentioned in the text, which provides strong support for the interaction.  2. The nature of the interaction is described as part of the sumoylation process, where PIAS1 acts as an E3 sumo ligase for Dnmt3a.  3. However, the text does not provide detailed information about the specific mechanisms or consequences of this interaction beyond its role in the sumoylation process.  4. The study focuses more on the overall effects of sumoylation on Dnmt3a's function rather than on the specific interaction between Dnmt3a and PIAS1.  Given these factors, we can conclude that Dnmt3a protein and PIAS1 protein do interact, but the level of detail provided about their specific interaction is limited, hence the medium confidence rating.

The passage states that "Dnmt3a interacts with multiple components of the sumoylation machinery, namely the E2 sumo conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and ... all of which are involved in conjugating the small ubiquitin-like modifier polypeptide, SUMO-1, to its target proteins."  This statement clearly indicates that Ubc9, as the E2 sumo conjugating enzyme, is directly involved in the process of attaching SUMO-1 to target proteins. The conjugation process inherently requires an interaction between the E2 enzyme (Ubc9) and the modifier protein (SUMO-1).   Furthermore, the context mentions that "Dnmt3a is modified by SUMO-1 in vivo and in vitro," which further supports the interaction between Ubc9 and SUMO-1, as Ubc9 is necessary for this modification process.  Therefore, we can conclude with high confidence that Ubc9 protein and SUMO-1 protein interact with each other in the context of the sumoylation process.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence suggesting an interaction between PIAS1 protein and SUMO-1 protein, although it's not explicitly stated that they directly interact with each other. The reasoning for this assessment is as follows:  1. The context mentions that PIAS1 is an E3 sumo ligase, which is involved in conjugating SUMO-1 to target proteins.  2. The text states that "Dnmt3a is modified by SUMO-1 in vivo and in vitro," indicating that SUMO-1 is being attached to Dnmt3a.  3. Since PIAS1 is described as an E3 sumo ligase involved in this process, it is likely that PIAS1 facilitates the attachment of SUMO-1 to Dnmt3a.  While the interaction between PIAS1 and SUMO-1 is not explicitly described, their functional relationship in the sumoylation process implies that they interact in some capacity. However, since the direct interaction is not explicitly stated, and we are inferring it from their functional roles, I've assigned a medium confidence level to this assessment.

The passage discusses how sumoylation (the process of attaching SUMO-1) affects Dnmt3a's ability to interact with other proteins and its capacity to repress transcription.  These points provide strong evidence for a direct interaction between Dnmt3a and SUMO-1 proteins, where SUMO-1 modifies Dnmt3a through a post-translational modification process called sumoylation.

This sentence clearly indicates that Dnmt3a protein and HDAC1 protein interact with each other under normal conditions. The interaction is disrupted when Dnmt3a is sumoylated, but this implies that the interaction exists in the absence of sumoylation.  The interaction between Dnmt3a and HDAC1 is presented as a significant aspect of Dnmt3a's function, particularly in relation to its ability to repress transcription. This further supports the conclusion that these two proteins interact with each other.

Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of perlecan, a specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan, to the beta-amyloid protein (A beta)-containing amyloid deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. In the present investigation, the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell (EC)- and smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived PGs to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits may be due to its interactions with perlecan. Pretreatment of AA amyloidotic splenic and liver tissue sections with synthetic A beta (1-28) produced strong immunoreactivity with A beta antibodies at tissue sites enriched in perlecan which was partially removed by pretreatment with heparitinase, but not by chondroitin ABC lyase. [35S]-Sulfate labeled proteoglycans (PGs) derived from cultured ECs and SMCs bound to affinity columns containing A beta (1-28) or (1-40), with virtually no binding to A beta (40-1) (reverse peptide), beta-amyloid precursor protein (410-429), or bovine serum albumin. Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan, weak binding by decorin and biglycan, two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Binding of 125I-labeled perlecan to A beta (1-28) was strongly inhibited by isolated perlecan and to a lesser extent by heparin, but not by chondroitin-6-sulfate or unsulfated dextran sulfate. Heparitinase treatment decreased, but did not eliminate the binding of 125I-labeled perlecan to A beta (1-28). Scatchard analysis of the interaction of A beta (1-28)- and EC-derived perlecan in solid-phase assays indicated high-affinity (Kd = 8.3 x 10(-11) M) and lower-affinity (Kd = 4.2 x 10(-8) M) binding sites, with approximately 1 mol of perlecan binding 1.8 mol of A beta. A significant decrease in binding of EC-derived perlecan to A beta (1-28) was observed when a sequence within the putative heparin-binding motif of A beta (His13His14Gln15Lys16) was replaced by the uncharged peptide sequence, Gly13Gly14Gln15Gly16, indicating a perlecan binding site on A beta near the postulated alpha-secretase site (at Lys-16).

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence   Explanation: The context suggests that PGs (proteoglycans) and perlecan protein interact with each other, as perlecan is described as a specific type of proteoglycan. The text states:  1. "Differential binding of vascular cell-derived proteoglycans (perlecan, biglycan, decorin, and versican) to the beta-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease."  2. "Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan..."  These statements indicate that perlecan is a type of proteoglycan, and both terms are discussed in the context of their binding to beta-amyloid protein. The interaction between PGs and perlecan is not explicitly stated as a direct interaction, but rather an inclusive relationship where perlecan is a subtype of PGs.  The confidence is medium because while the relationship between PGs and perlecan is clear, their direct interaction is not explicitly described. Instead, their relationship is more of a categorical nature, with perlecan being a specific type of proteoglycan.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence that PGs (proteoglycans) and decorin (a specific proteoglycan) interact with each other, albeit in a limited way. The text mentions that decorin, along with other proteoglycans, binds to beta-amyloid protein (A beta):  "Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan, weak binding by decorin and biglycan, two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan."  This indicates that decorin, as a specific type of proteoglycan, is part of the broader category of PGs that interact with A beta. While the interaction between decorin and A beta is described as weak, it still demonstrates a form of interaction within the broader context of proteoglycan binding to A beta.  The confidence level is medium because while there is a clear mention of decorin as a proteoglycan that binds to A beta, the interaction is described as weak, and the primary focus of the study appears to be on perlecan rather than decorin specifically.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: The context indicates that both PGs (proteoglycans) and biglycan interact with beta-amyloid protein (A beta), albeit to different degrees.

This suggests that both PGs (as a general category) and biglycan (a specific type of proteoglycan) interact with A beta, although biglycan shows weaker binding compared to perlecan. While the interaction is not directly between PGs and biglycan, they are both involved in similar processes of binding to A beta, which indicates a functional interaction in the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology.  The confidence is rated as medium because while there is clear evidence of both terms interacting with A beta, their direct interaction with each other is not explicitly stated, and the strength of their individual interactions varies.

The CD53 pan-leukocyte glycoprotein is a member of the recently described tetraspan family of cell membrane proteins. The structure and functional characteristics of these molecules indicate that they may play important roles in transmembrane signaling in different cells. Recently, it was reported that cross-linking of CD53 on human B cells led to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium fluxes. In the present study, we wished to further explore the possible role of CD53 in functional B cell responses. Cross-linking of CD53 with the use of the mAb MEM-53 and a polyclonal sheep anti-mouse Ig promoted activation of resting B cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle as judged by increased expression of the early activation Ag CD69, increases in cellular volume, RNA synthesis, and c-myc protein levels, and enhanced binding of 7-aminoactinomycin D. In contrast, MEM-53 alone had no detectable effects. Cross-linking of anti-CD53 induced negligible S phase entry in the absence of other stimuli. However, cytokines, in particular IL-2 and IL-4, potentiated the DNA synthesis induced by cross-linking of CD53.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence of an indirect interaction between CD53 protein and CD69 protein, although they are not directly described as interacting with each other. The interaction is implied through the following observations:  1. Cross-linking of CD53 promotes activation of resting B cells. 2. This activation is characterized by increased expression of the early activation antigen CD69.  Specifically, the text states: "Cross-linking of CD53 with the use of the mAb MEM-53 and a polyclonal sheep anti-mouse Ig promoted activation of resting B cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle as judged by increased expression of the early activation Ag CD69."  This suggests that CD53 activation leads to increased expression of CD69, indicating a functional relationship between the two proteins in the context of B cell activation. While this is not a direct physical interaction, it does represent a biological interaction in terms of cellular signaling and activation processes.  The confidence level is medium because the interaction is not explicitly stated as a direct protein-protein interaction, but rather as a functional relationship in the context of B cell activation. Further research would be needed to determine if there is a more direct interaction between these two proteins.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: The context suggests an indirect interaction between CD53 protein and c-myc protein, although it's not a direct physical interaction. The cross-linking of CD53 leads to various cellular responses, including an increase in c-myc protein levels. Specifically, the text states:  "Cross-linking of CD53 with the use of the mAb MEM-53 and a polyclonal sheep anti-mouse Ig promoted activation of resting B cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle as judged by increased expression of the early activation Ag CD69, increases in cellular volume, RNA synthesis, and c-myc protein levels..."  This indicates that CD53 activation through cross-linking results in increased levels of c-myc protein, suggesting a functional relationship between these two proteins in the B cell activation pathway. While this is not a direct physical interaction, it does demonstrate a clear biological connection between CD53 signaling and c-myc protein expression.  The confidence level is medium because while there is a clear relationship between CD53 activation and c-myc protein levels, the exact mechanism of this interaction is not explicitly described, and it may involve intermediate steps or other cellular components.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence suggesting an interaction between IL-2 protein and CD53 protein, although it's not explicitly stated that they directly interact. The interaction is inferred from the following information:  1. Cross-linking of CD53 promotes activation of resting B cells, as evidenced by various cellular responses.  2. The study mentions that "cytokines, in particular IL-2 and IL-4, potentiated the DNA synthesis induced by cross-linking of CD53."  This statement suggests that IL-2 enhances or augments the effects of CD53 cross-linking on B cell activation, specifically in terms of DNA synthesis. While this doesn't necessarily imply a direct physical interaction between IL-2 and CD53 proteins, it does indicate a functional interaction or synergy in their effects on B cell activation.  The confidence level is medium because: 1. The interaction is not explicitly described as a direct protein-protein interaction. 2. The study doesn't provide detailed molecular mechanisms of how IL-2 potentiates the effects of CD53 cross-linking. 3. However, there is clear evidence of a functional relationship between the two proteins in the context of B cell activation.  Given this information, we can conclude that there is an interaction between IL-2 and CD53 in terms of their combined effects on B cell activation, even if it's not a direct physical interaction between the proteins themselves.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: The context suggests that IL-4 protein and CD53 protein interact with each other in the process of B cell activation and differentiation. Specifically:  1. The study demonstrates that cross-linking of CD53 promotes activation of resting human B lymphocytes.  2. IL-4 is mentioned as a cytokine that potentiates the DNA synthesis induced by cross-linking of CD53: "cytokines, in particular IL-2 and IL-4, potentiated the DNA synthesis induced by cross-linking of CD53."  This indicates that IL-4 enhances the effect of CD53 cross-linking on B cell activation, suggesting an interaction between the two proteins in this cellular process. However, the exact molecular mechanism of this interaction is not explicitly described in the given context, which is why I've assigned a medium confidence level to this interaction.  The interaction between IL-4 and CD53 appears to be functional rather than direct physical binding, as IL-4 is enhancing the effects of CD53 signaling in B cell activation. This type of functional interaction is similar to the example provided where two drugs interact to produce a combined effect that is different from the effect of either drug alone.

Involucrin was the first protein to be identified as a likely constituent of the insoluble cornified cell envelope (CE) of stratified squamous epithelia. However, to date, direct isolation from CEs of involucrin cross-linked by way of the transglutaminase-induced isopeptide bond has not been reported. We have treated human foreskin CEs with methanol/KOH (saponification) to hydrolyze off much of the lipids. By immunogold electron microscopy, this exposed large amounts of involucrin epitopes as well as of desmoplakin, a desmosomal structural protein.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence suggesting that involucrin protein and cystatin alpha protein interact with each other within the cornified cell envelope (CE) structure. The text states:  "Subsequent amino acid sequencing revealed many peptides involving involucrin cross-linked either to itself or to a variety of other known CE protein components, including cystatin alpha, desmoplakin, elafin, keratins, members of the small proline-rich superfamily, loricrin, and unknown proteins related to the desmoplakin family."  This passage directly mentions that involucrin is cross-linked to cystatin alpha, among other proteins, within the CE structure. Cross-linking indicates a physical interaction between these proteins, as they are covalently bonded together through transglutaminase-induced isopeptide bonds.  The confidence level is medium because while the interaction is explicitly mentioned, the text does not provide specific details about the nature of the cross-linking between involucrin and cystatin alpha (such as the specific amino acid residues involved), unlike some of the other interactions described for involucrin. Additionally, cystatin alpha is mentioned as part of a list of proteins that interact with involucrin, rather than being the focus of a more detailed discussion.

HPRD50.d6 HPRD50.d6.s4.e0 HPRD50.d6.s4.e1	Jak2	STAT3	[INST]Context: [PMID: 10925297 Regulation of neutrophil adhesion by pituitary growth hormone accompanies tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, p125FAK, and paxillin. Neutrophil adhesion is fundamentally important during the onset of inflammatory responses. The adhesion signaling pathways control neutrophil arrest and extravasation and influence neutrophil shape and function at sites of inflammation. In the present study the intracellular signaling pathways for the adhesion of human neutrophils by pituitary growth hormone (GH) were examined. Pituitary GH triggered the tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and STAT3 in neutrophils. In addition, pituitary GH treatment resulted in the morphological changes and the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) and paxillin. Preincubation with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the GH-stimulated adhesion and Jak2, STAT3, p125FAK, and paxillin phosphorylation. Confocal microscopy revealed that pituitary GH stimulates the focal localization of p125FAK, paxillin, phosphotyrosine, and filamentous actin filament into the membrane rufflings and uropods of human neutrophils. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a physical association of Jak2 with p125FAK via STAT3 in vivo. Also an in vitro kinase assay showed an augmentation of p125FAK autophosphorylation as a result of pituitary GH treatment. These results suggest that pituitary GH modulates neutrophil adhesion through tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, p125FAK, and paxillin and actin polymerization.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Jak2 protein] and [STAT3 protein] interact with each other?

The context suggests that Jak2 protein and STAT3 protein interact with each other in the signaling pathway triggered by pituitary growth hormone (GH) in neutrophils. This interaction is evidenced by the following points:  1. The text states that "Pituitary GH triggered the tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and STAT3 in neutrophils." This indicates that both proteins are activated in the same signaling cascade.  2. The study mentions that "Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a physical association of Jak2 with p125FAK via STAT3 in vivo." This suggests that STAT3 acts as an intermediary between Jak2 and p125FAK, implying an interaction between Jak2 and STAT3.  3. The involvement of both Jak2 and STAT3 in the same signaling pathway (GH-stimulated adhesion) and their concurrent phosphorylation further support their interaction.  However, the confidence level is rated as medium because:  1. The text does not explicitly state a direct interaction between Jak2 and STAT3. 2. While the physical association of Jak2 with p125FAK via STAT3 is mentioned, the exact nature of this association is not fully described. 3. More detailed experiments specifically focusing on the Jak2-STAT3 interaction would be needed to increase the confidence level.

The context provides strong evidence that sialoadhesin protein and CD43 protein interact with each other. Here's the explanation:  1. The study directly identifies CD43 as a counterreceptor for sialoadhesin on T lymphocytes.  2. Sialoadhesin-Fc fusion proteins precipitated several glycoproteins from a T cell line, including a 130 kDa glycoprotein that was identified as CD43.  3.

We recently found a novel GPI-anchored protein, GPI-80, on human phagocytes that may regulate leukocyte adherence, locomotion, and extravasation. To clarify the mechanisms by which GPI-80 functions on leukocytes, we explored the possibility of its physical association with beta 2 integrin which is important for leukocyte adherence, locomotion, and extravasation. beta 2 integrin, detected by anti-CD18 mAb, was coprecipitated with GPI-80 from human neutrophil lysates by a mAb to GPI-80. In addition, GPI-80 was immunoprecipitated from human neutrophil lysates by anti-human CD18 mAb. These results clearly show that GPI-80 is physically associated with beta 2 integrin in human neutrophils.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GPI-80 protein] and [CD18 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

The context provides clear evidence of a physical association between GPI-80 protein and CD18 protein (which is part of beta 2 integrin). This interaction is demonstrated through two key findings:  1. Beta 2 integrin (detected by anti-CD18 mAb) was coprecipitated with GPI-80 from human neutrophil lysates using a monoclonal antibody to GPI-80.  2. GPI-80 was immunoprecipitated from human neutrophil lysates using an anti-human CD18 monoclonal antibody.  These results directly show that GPI-80 and CD18 (as part of beta 2 integrin) physically associate with each other in human neutrophils. The study explicitly states, "These results clearly show that GPI-80 is physically associated with beta 2 integrin in human neutrophils."  This interaction is similar to the example of interacting proteins provided, where two entities are shown to have a direct physical association or influence on each other's function. The high confidence level is warranted due to the clear and direct evidence presented in the context.

Cross-linking B cell antigen receptor (BCR) elicits early signal transduction events, including activation of protein tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of receptor components, activation of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma), and increases in intracellular free Ca2+. In this article, we report that cross-linking the BCR led to a rapid translocation of cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1C to the particulate fraction, where it became associated with a 140-150-kD tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein. Western blotting analysis identified this 140-150-kD protein to be CD22. The association of PTP-1C with CD22 was mediated by the NH2-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of PTP-1C.

In COS cells, transient expression of CD22 and a null mutant of PTP-1C (PTP-1CM) results in increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of CD22 and its interaction with PTP-1CM.  5. The context suggests that tyrosyl-phosphorylated CD22 may be a substrate for PTP-1C, which regulates the tyrosyl phosphorylation of CD22.  These observations provide strong evidence for a direct interaction between PTP-1C and CD22 proteins, with PTP-1C playing a role in regulating the phosphorylation state of CD22.

In this article, we report that cross-linking the BCR led to a rapid translocation of cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1C to the particulate fraction, where it became associated with a 140-150-kD tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein. Western blotting analysis identified this 140-150-kD protein to be CD22. The association of PTP-1C with CD22 was mediated by the NH2-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of PTP-1C.

Based on the provided context, CD22 protein and PTP-1C protein interact with each other. The evidence for this interaction is strong and direct:  1. The context states that "cross-linking the BCR led to a rapid translocation of cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1C to the particulate fraction, where it became associated with a 140-150-kD tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein." This protein was then identified as CD22.  2. The association between CD22 and PTP-1C is explicitly mentioned: "The association of PTP-1C with CD22 was mediated by the NH2-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of PTP-1C."  3. The context describes complexes containing both CD22 and PTP-1C: "Complexes of either CD22/PTP-1C/Syk/PLC-gamma(1) could be isolated from B cells stimulated by BCR engagement or a mixture of hydrogen peroxidase and sodium orthovanadate, respectively."  4. The study also showed that "Transient expression of CD22 and a null mutant of PTP-1C (PTP-1CM) in COS cells resulted in an increase in tyrosyl phosphorylation of CD22 and its interaction with PTP-1CM."  5. Finally, the context suggests a regulatory relationship between the two proteins: "tyrosyl-phosphorylated CD22 may be a substrate for PTP-1C regulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of CD22."  These multiple lines of evidence clearly demonstrate a direct interaction between CD22 protein and PTP-1C protein, supporting a high confidence assessment of their interaction.

The context states that "TFIID dimers formed through self-association of the TATA-binding polypeptide (TBP) subunit and could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to TAF(II)250." This implies that TAF(II)250 is part of the TFIID complex and can be used to pull down the entire TFIID complex, further supporting their interaction.  3. The formation of TFIID dimers involves both the TBP subunit and TAF(II)250, indicating that these components work together within the TFIID complex.  Given this clear evidence of TAF(II)250 being an integral part of the TFIID complex and their co-occurrence in the same protein complex, we can conclude with high confidence that TAF(II)250 protein and TFIID protein interact with each other.

In contrast to IkappaBbeta, Bcl3 did not interact with the AF2 domain of RXR. Bcl3 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIA but not with TFIIEalpha in the GST pull-down assays.
