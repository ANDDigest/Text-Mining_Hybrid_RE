536985 2A2773317 2A2763386	RPA32	RAD51	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34681076 The Intrinsically Disordered Region in the Human STN1 OB-Fold Domain Is Important for Protecting Genome Stability. The mammalian CTC1-STN1-TEN1 complex is an ssDNA-binding protein complex that has emerged as an important player in protecting genome stability and preserving telomere integrity. While considered to be RPA-like, ctc1-stn1-ten1 acts distinctly from RPA to protect genome stability. Here, we report that while the OB domain of STN1 shares structural similarity with the OB domain of RPA32, the STN1-OB domain contains an intrinsically disordered region that is important for maintaining genome stability under replication stress. While intrinsically disordered region mutations do not impact ctc1-stn1-ten1 complex formation or ctc1-stn1-ten1 interaction with its binding partner RAD51, they diminish RAD51 foci formation when replication is perturbed. Collectively, our results identify the STN1 intrinsically disordered region as an important element in regulating ctc1-stn1-ten1 function in genome stability maintenance.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [RPA32 protein] and [RAD51 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between RPA32 protein and RAD51 protein. The passage mentions that STN1's OB domain shares structural similarity with the OB domain of RPA32, but it does not indicate any interaction between RPA32 and RAD51.   The text does mention that RAD51 is a binding partner of the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 complex, and that mutations in the intrinsically disordered region of STN1 affect RAD51 foci formation. However, this interaction is specifically noted for the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 complex and RAD51, not for RPA32 and RAD51.  The medium confidence level is assigned because while there's no explicit mention of interaction between RPA32 and RAD51, the context doesn't provide enough information to completely rule out any potential indirect relationship or interaction in other cellular processes not discussed in this specific passage.

While the cytological features of hepatocellular carcinoma on fine needle aspiration cytology are well described, cases of hepatocellular carcinoma with malignant cells in ascitic fluid and their characteristics are not. A patient is described with cirrhosis resulting from chronic hepatitis B virus infection, ascites, and hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed by effusion cytology. The malignant cells in the effusion were shown to be positive for alpha fetoprotein using immunocytochemistry, and for human albumin using in situ hybridisation, confirming the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Further investigations in a terminally ill patient were thus avoided.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [alpha fetoprotein protein] and [albumin protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no clear indication that alpha fetoprotein protein and albumin protein directly interact with each other. The passage mentions both proteins, but they are used as separate diagnostic markers for hepatocellular carcinoma:  1. Alpha fetoprotein was detected using immunocytochemistry. 2. Human albumin was detected using in situ hybridization.  Both markers were used to confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, but the text does not suggest any interaction between these two proteins. They appear to be independent indicators of the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in the ascitic fluid.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no explicit mention of interaction, the context doesn't provide enough information to completely rule out the possibility of some form of indirect interaction or relationship between these proteins in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma.
368353 2A2871148 2A2739390	Sequestosome-1	profilin-1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 31824497 Common Neurodegeneration-Associated Proteins Are Physiologically Expressed by Human B Lymphocytes and Are Interconnected via the Inflammation/Autophagy-Related Proteins TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6 and Sequestosome-1. On another hand, several genes involved in familial forms of neurodegenerative diseases exert key innate immune functions. First, we retrieved the expression patterns of common neurodegeneration-associated proteins in two professional antigen-presenting cells, namely B lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Surprisingly, we found that under physiological conditions, numerous neurodegeneration-associated proteins are abundantly expressed by human B lymphocytes. A survey of the human proteome allowed us to map a unique protein-protein interaction network linking common neurodegeneration-associated proteins and their first shell interactors in human B lymphocytes. Interestingly, network connectivity analysis identified two major hubs that both relate with inflammation and autophagy, namely TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6 and Sequestosome-1 . Moreover, the mapped network in B lymphocytes comprised two additional hub proteins involved in both inflammation and autoimmunity: HSPA8 (Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 8 also known as HSC70) and HSP90AA1 (Heat Shock Protein 90 Alpha Family Class A Member 1). Based on these results, we then explored the Immune Epitope Database 'IEDB-AR' and actually found that a large share of neurodegeneration-associated proteins were previously reported to provide endogenous MHC class II-binding peptides in human B lymphocytes. Of note, peptides deriving from amyloid beta A4 protein, sequestosome-1 or profilin-1 were reported to bind multiple allele-specific MHC class II molecules. In contrast, peptides deriving from microtubule-associated protein tau, presenilin 2 and serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1 were exclusively reported to bind MHC molecules encoded by the HLA-DRB1 1501 allele, a recently-identified susceptibility gene for late onset Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we observed that the whole list of proteins reported to provide endogenous MHC class II-binding peptides in human B lymphocytes is specifically enriched in neurodegeneration-associated proteins. Overall, our work indicates that immunization against neurodegeneration-associated proteins might be a physiological process which is shaped, at least in part, by B lymphocytes.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Sequestosome-1 protein] and [profilin-1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: While the passage does not explicitly state a direct interaction between Sequestosome-1 protein and profilin-1 protein, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest they may be indirectly connected within the context of neurodegeneration-associated proteins in B lymphocytes:  1. Both Sequestosome-1 and profilin-1 are mentioned as neurodegeneration-associated proteins that are expressed in human B lymphocytes.  2. The passage describes a protein-protein interaction network linking common neurodegeneration-associated proteins and their first shell interactors in human B lymphocytes. Although not explicitly stated, this suggests that these proteins may be interconnected within this network.  3. Both Sequestosome-1 and profilin-1 are mentioned as proteins that provide endogenous MHC class II-binding peptides in human B lymphocytes, indicating they may be involved in similar immune-related processes.  4. Sequestosome-1 is identified as one of the major hubs in the network, which suggests it may interact with multiple other proteins in the system, potentially including profilin-1.  While these points suggest a possible indirect interaction or connection between Sequestosome-1 and profilin-1, the lack of explicit evidence for a direct interaction leads to a medium confidence level in this assessment. Further research would be needed to confirm any direct interaction between these two proteins.
43261 2A2918856 2A2909421	prealbumin	transferrin	[INST]Context: [PMID: 12032204 Significance of high C-reactive protein levels in pre-dialysis patients. BACKGROUND: An elevated serum C-reactive protein has been shown to be strongly predictive of morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. METHODS: A cohort of 66 pre-dialysis patients was followed for 1 year, after initial determination of serum c-reactive protein. The evolution of blood pressure control, c-reactive protein levels, nutritional data (body mass index, serum albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, cholesterol), proteinuria, calcium-phosphorus product, bicarbonate, haemoglobin, the weekly dose of erythropoietin /kg body weight, and the Hb/erythropoietin dose ratio were measured and compared between patients with high (>6 mg/l) or low (<6 mg/l) c-reactive protein levels at baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, 23 patients (35%) showed high (>6 mg/l) c-reactive protein levels. C-reactive protein was higher in patients with a previous history of cardiovascular disease (P<0.01), as well as in patients in whom ischaemic nephropathy or nephrosclerosis was the cause of end-stage renal disease (P<0.01). There were no differences between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. During the study period, patients with higher c-reactive protein levels at baseline maintained higher levels (P<0.001). During this period, these patients showed lower (P<0.05) albumin concentration, higher bicarbonate levels, lower haemoglobin concentration, and lower Hb/erythropoietin ratio and needed higher erythropoietin doses. There were no differences in systolic blood pressure, the degree of proteinuria, and the decline in renal function between groups; Diastolic blood pressure was lower in patients with high c-reactive protein levels. Only one patient died. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of inflammation is high in pre-dialysis patients. As occurs in dialysis patients, pre-dialysis inflammation predicts lower serum albumin concentration, poorer response to erythropoietin, and a higher hospitalization rate.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [prealbumin protein] and [transferrin protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of an interaction between prealbumin protein and transferrin protein. The study mentions these proteins along with other nutritional markers (body mass index, serum albumin, cholesterol) as part of the nutritional data collected from patients. However, the text does not describe any specific relationship or interaction between prealbumin and transferrin.  The study primarily focuses on the relationship between C-reactive protein levels and various clinical parameters in pre-dialysis patients. While prealbumin and transferrin are both mentioned as part of the nutritional data collected, there is no information provided about how these two proteins might interact with each other or influence each other's levels or functions.  Given the lack of specific information about the relationship between prealbumin and transferrin, we cannot conclude that they interact based on this context. However, since both proteins are related to nutritional status and are often used as markers in similar clinical contexts, there is a possibility of some indirect relationship, which is why I've assigned a medium confidence level to this assessment.
441383 2A2703005 2A2636030	OPN	LAMTOR5	[INST]Context: [PMID: 31836847 LAMTOR5 raises abnormal initiation of O-glycosylation in breast cancer metastasis via modulating GALNT1 activity. During malignancy, perturbed O-glycosylation confers global influence on cancer progression. As a hallmark of cancer metastasis, GalNAc-type O-glycosylation initiation is aberrantly raised, but the regulatory mechanism is still mysterious. Here, we show that LAMTOR5 raises abnormal initiation of O-glycosylation in breast cancer metastasis. LAMTOR5 was highly expressed in adenocarcinoma and correlated with Tn antigen, a product of O-glycosylation initiation, in both clinical metastatic breast cancer specimens and secondary metastasis mouse model. LAMTOR5-modulated O-glycosylation initiating enzyme GALNT1 conferred Tn accumulation and predicted poor survival. Mechanistically, LAMTOR5 stimulated transcriptions of GALNT1 through coactivating c-Jun, and triggered dislocation of GALNT1 in the endoplasmic reticulum via LAMTOR5 dependent-activation of c-Src. This unusual initiation of O-glycosylation resulted in the abundance of Tn modified glycoproteins, such as MUC1 and OPN. Collectively, our findings indicate that LAMTOR5/c-Jun/c-Src axis serves as the upstream regulator of abnormal O-glycosylation initiation and potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer metastasis. Mice.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [OPN protein] and [LAMTOR5 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Based on the provided context, there is evidence to suggest that LAMTOR5 protein and OPN (Osteopontin) protein interact, albeit indirectly. The passage states:  "This unusual initiation of O-glycosylation resulted in the abundance of Tn modified glycoproteins, such as MUC1 and OPN."  This indicates that LAMTOR5, through its role in regulating abnormal O-glycosylation initiation, affects the modification of OPN. Specifically:  1. LAMTOR5 is shown to raise abnormal initiation of O-glycosylation in breast cancer metastasis. 2. LAMTOR5 modulates GALNT1, an O-glycosylation initiating enzyme. 3. This unusual initiation of O-glycosylation leads to an abundance of Tn-modified glycoproteins, including OPN.  While this is not a direct protein-protein interaction, it does represent a functional interaction where LAMTOR5's activity influences the post-translational modification of OPN. This type of indirect interaction through a cellular process (in this case, O-glycosylation) can be considered a form of functional interaction between the two proteins.  The confidence is rated as medium because while there is a clear connection between LAMTOR5's activity and OPN's modification, it's not a direct physical interaction, and the exact mechanisms of how LAMTOR5's activity translates to OPN modification are not fully detailed in the given context.
102594 2A2704682 2A2537764	p53	FGFR-3	[INST]Context: [PMID: 33144356 Murine double minute 2 gene amplification as selection tool for innovative targeted approaches in programmed death ligand 1 positive or negative muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma. AIMS: According to The Cancer Genome Atlas, around 9% of bladder carcinomas usually show abnormalities of the murine double minute 2 gene, but a few studies have been investigated them. We profiled murine double minute 2 gene amplification in a series of urothelial carcinomas considering the molecular subtypes and expression of programmed death ligand 1 . METHODS: 117 patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinomas (pT2-3) without (N0) or with (N+) lymph-node metastases were revised. Tissue microarray was built. p53, ER, RB1, GATA-3, CK20, CK5/6, CD44 and programmed death ligand 1 (clone sp263) immunoexpression was evaluated. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation was assessed by using the HER-2/neu, FGFR-3, CDKN2A and murine double minute 2 probes. Murine double minute 2 and programmed death ligand 1 values were correlated to the the cancer genome atlas molecular phenotypes. Of 50, 14 (37%) cases expressed programmed death ligand 1 at 1% cut-off; Of these, 2 cases on side of neoplasia among inflammatory cells. Only one out of six (17%) cases amplified for murine double minute 2 showed expression (>50% cut-off) of programmed death ligand 1. CONCLUSION: murine double minute 2 amplification has been seen in both programmed death ligand 1 positive and negative muscle-invasive bladder urothelial carcinomas independently from the the cancer genome atlas molecular phenotypes. Murine double minute 2 and programmed death ligand 1 might be assessed in order to predict a better response to combo/single targeted therapies.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [p53 protein] and [FGFR-3 protein] interact with each other?

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between p53 protein and FGFR-3 protein. The text mentions both p53 and FGFR-3, but they are listed separately among other proteins and genes that were evaluated in the study. There is no information provided about any relationship or interaction between these two specific proteins.  The study focuses on murine double minute 2 (MDM2) gene amplification and its relationship with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in urothelial carcinomas. While p53 and FGFR-3 are mentioned as part of the evaluation process, there is no discussion about their potential interaction.  Given the limited information provided and the lack of any statement suggesting an interaction between p53 and FGFR-3, I cannot conclude that these proteins interact. However, I express low confidence in this assessment because the absence of evidence in this specific context does not necessarily mean there is no interaction between these proteins in other contexts or studies not mentioned here.

When glycated haemoglobin is estimated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography, one of the fractions that are eluted is known as 'P3' fraction which is labelled as 'degenerated haemoglobin'. The P3 fraction is not taken into account while estimating haemoglobin or HbA values. AIM: To study the effect of P3 on the final reported value of haemoglobin by high performance liquid chromatography and the significance of this fraction in the final chromatogram. The possibility that haemoglobin fraction is under reported due to increase in P3 fraction was also examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: haemoglobin, various fractions of HbA1 and P3 were estimated by high performance liquid chromatography method in 430 subjects. Patient data was divided into 3 groups on the basis of HbA1c% (group I - <6%, group II - 6 - 12%, group III - >12%). RESULT: P3% as well as P3 area increases as the haemoglobin increases (p-value - <0.001). Statistical significant increase was seen as HbA1c% increases, P3% also increases and correlation (r = 0.6) became stronger with increasing haemoglobin levels. CONCLUSION: From this study we conclude that sub fractions of glycated haemoglobin and P3 fraction influence the final reported value of haemoglobin by high performance liquid chromatography. P3 fraction might indicate the possible presence of variant haemoglobin in the sample.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [HbA protein] and [HbA1 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of an interaction between HbA protein and HbA1 protein. The context primarily discusses the P3 fraction and its relationship with haemoglobin and HbA1c levels. While HbA1 is mentioned as one of the fractions measured by high performance liquid chromatography, there is no specific information about its interaction with HbA protein.  The text focuses on the effect of P3 fraction on the reported haemoglobin values and its relationship with increasing HbA1c levels. It does not provide any information about a direct interaction between HbA and HbA1 proteins.  The medium confidence level is assigned because while there is no explicit mention of interaction between these two proteins, the context is specifically about haemoglobin analysis, and these proteins are closely related in the broader context of hemoglobin variants. However, without more specific information about their interaction, we cannot conclude that they interact based solely on this passage.
126791 2A2590057 2A2592321	HSP90	HSP27	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34353437 INTRODUCTION: Heat shock proteins constitute a large family of proteins involved in protein folding and maturation. HSP expression is induced by heat shock or other stressors including cellular damage and hypoxia. The major groups, which are classified based on their molecular weight, include HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and large HSP (HSP110 and glucose-regulated protein 170). Heat shock proteins play a significant role in cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis. The human HSP90 family consists of five members and has a strong association with cancer. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to review the important functions of heat shock protein 90 in cancer, especially as an anti-cancer drug target. RESULTS: The HSP90 proteins not only play important roles in cancer development, progression, and metastasis, but also have potential clinical use as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis or assessing disease progression, and as therapeutic targets for cancer therapy. In this chapter, we discuss the roles of HSP90 in cancer biology and pharmacology, focusing on HSP90 as an anti-cancer drug target. An understanding of the functions and molecular mechanisms of HSP90 is critical for enhancing the accuracy of cancer diagnosis as well as for developing more effective and less toxic chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: We have provided an overview of the complex relationship between cancer and HSP90. HSP90 proteins play an important role in tumorigenesis and may be used as potential clinical biomarkers for the diagnosis and predicting prognostic outcome of patients with cancer. HSP90 proteins may be used as therapeutic targets for cancer therapy, prompting discovery and development of novel chemotherapeutic agents.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [HSP90 protein] and [HSP27 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence  The context provided does not explicitly describe any direct interaction between HSP90 protein and HSP27 protein. While both are mentioned as members of the heat shock protein family, they are listed separately and no specific relationship or interaction between them is discussed.  The text primarily focuses on HSP90 and its role in cancer, without mentioning any particular connection to HSP27. HSP27 is only briefly mentioned as one of the major groups of heat shock proteins, classified based on molecular weight.  However, given that both proteins are part of the heat shock protein family and involved in similar cellular processes (such as protein folding and stress response), it's possible that there could be some indirect interactions or functional relationships between them in certain contexts. This is why I've assigned a medium confidence level to this assessment.  To definitively state whether these proteins interact, we would need more specific information about their molecular relationships, which is not provided in this context.

Fortunately, the human protein-protein interaction network could be a useful resource to achieve this objective. RESULTS: We applied our computational framework to prioritize novel putative target genes for Alzheimer's disease and successfully identified key genes that may serve as novel therapeutic targets (e.g., DLG4, EGFR, RAC1, SYK, PTK2B, SOCS1). Furthermore, based on these putative targets, we could infer repositionable candidate-compounds for the disease (e.g., tamoxifen, bosutinib, and dasatinib).] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [EGFR protein] and [SYK protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of an interaction between EGFR protein and SYK protein. The text lists these proteins (along with others like DLG4, RAC1, PTK2B, and SOCS1) as examples of "key genes that may serve as novel therapeutic targets" for Alzheimer's disease. However, the context does not provide any information about how these proteins might interact with each other.  The text is focused on describing a computational framework for identifying potential drug targets and repositionable drugs for Alzheimer's disease. It mentions that the human protein-protein interaction network was used as a resource, but it doesn't specify any particular interactions between the listed proteins.  While it's possible that EGFR and SYK proteins might interact in some biological contexts, this specific interaction is not mentioned or implied in the given text. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, we cannot conclude that these two proteins interact with each other in the context of this study.  The confidence is medium because while there's no indication of interaction in the text, we also can't completely rule out the possibility of an interaction that wasn't explicitly mentioned in this brief summary.

A considerable number of studies reported side effects induced by the khat extracts to both embryos and adults. These include teratogenicity and developmental retardation, oral cancer and ulcers, high blood pressure, and myocardial infarction. We aimed in this study to investigate this through evaluating the effects of khat extracts on SKOV3, a human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line. We show, by in vitro assays, that khat induces several cellular defects including reduced cell size, cell membrane damage, and apoptosis. At high khat extract concentrations, the cell metabolic activity, cell cycle, and cellular proliferation were affected. RT-qPCR analysis showed an increase in the gene expression of the apoptotic marker BAX, the tumor suppressor p53, and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Protein expression analysis by immunostaining showed downregulation of beta-catenin, E-cadherin, and Ki-67 and upregulation of FZD8 and SPRY2, suggesting that Wnt and FGF signaling were implicated. SwissTargetPrediction in silico analysis showed that khat constituents cathine, cathinone, catheduline K2, and catheduline E5 bind to family A G-protein-coupled receptor, cause many neurological diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety, and induce many ovarian cancer-related diseases. The analysis also showed that important signaling pathways such as CREB, Wnt, FGF, IL-6, and ERK/MAPK, and that of the endometrial cancer, and cell cycle were implicated. Upstream regulators of cathine and cathinone were found to potentially target several molecules including interleukin-8, MMP2, PLAU, and micro-RNAs.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [tumor suppressor p53 protein] and [CREB protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence.  Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a direct interaction between the tumor suppressor p53 protein and the CREB protein. While both proteins are mentioned in the text, they appear in separate contexts:  1. The tumor suppressor p53 is mentioned as having increased gene expression in response to khat extract treatment.  2. CREB is mentioned as one of the signaling pathways implicated in the effects of khat constituents, as revealed by SwissTargetPrediction in silico analysis.  However, the text does not provide any information about these two proteins interacting with each other or working together in a common pathway. They are simply listed as separate entities affected by khat extract or its constituents.  Given that both proteins are involved in cellular signaling and gene regulation, it's possible that they might have some indirect interactions or be part of related pathways, but this is not explicitly stated in the given context. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, we cannot conclude that these proteins interact with each other.
50840 2A2865919 2A2889302	SNAP-25	synaptotagmin-1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 32913390 Fluid Biomarkers for Synaptic Dysfunction and Loss. Synapses are the site for brain communication where information is transmitted between neurons and stored for memory formation. Synaptic degeneration is a global and early pathogenic event in neurodegenerative disorders with reduced levels of pre- and postsynaptic proteins being recognized as a core feature of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Together with alzheimer's disease, other neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders show altered synaptic homeostasis as an important pathogenic event, and due to that, they are commonly referred to as synaptopathies. The exact mechanisms of synapse dysfunction in the different diseases are not well understood and their study would help understanding the pathogenic role of synaptic degeneration, as well as differences and commonalities among them and highlight candidate synaptic biomarkers for specific disorders. The assessment of synaptic proteins in cerebrospinal fluid, which can reflect synaptic dysfunction in patients with cognitive disorders, is a keen area of interest. Substantial research efforts are now directed toward the investigation of cerebrospinal fluid synaptic pathology to improve the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders at an early stage as well as to monitor clinical progression. In this review, we will first summarize the pathological events that lead to synapse loss and then discuss the available data on established (eg, neurogranin, SNAP-25, synaptotagmin-1, GAP-43, and alpha-syn) and emerging (eg, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A and neuronal pentraxins) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for synapse dysfunction, while highlighting possible utilities, disease specificity, and technical challenges for their detection.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SNAP-25 protein] and [synaptotagmin-1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

[YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: While the context does not explicitly state a direct interaction between SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin-1, there are several factors that suggest these proteins likely interact or are closely related in function:  1. Both SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin-1 are listed together as "established" cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for synapse dysfunction.  2. They are both synaptic proteins involved in neurotransmitter release and synaptic function.  3. SNAP-25 (Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa) is a component of the SNARE complex, which is essential for synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.  4. Synaptotagmin-1 is a calcium sensor protein that interacts with the SNARE complex to trigger synaptic vesicle fusion.  Given their roles in synaptic function and their mention together as established biomarkers, it is likely that SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin-1 interact functionally in the synaptic vesicle release process. However, since the context does not explicitly state their interaction, I've assigned a medium confidence level to this assessment.
65640 2A2547785 2A2451372	GAPDH	CALX	[INST]Context: [PMID: 22272336 Uncovering suitable reference proteins for expression studies in human adipose tissue with relevance to obesity. BACKGROUND: Protein expression studies based on the two major intra-abdominal human fat depots, the subcutaneous and the omental fat, can shed light into the mechanisms involved in obesity and its co-morbidities. Immunoblotting analysis was used to confirm in adipose tissue the expression pattern of the potential reference proteins and three proteins were validated: PARK7, ENOA and FAA. ENOA, PARK7 and the customary loading control protein Beta-actin showed steady expression profiles in fat from non-obese and obese individuals, whilst FAA maintained steady expression levels across paired omental and subcutaneous fat samples. CONCLUSIONS: ENOA, PARK7 and Beta-actin are proper reference standards in obesity studies based on omental fat, whilst FAA is the best loading control for the comparative analysis of omental and subcutaneous adipose tissues either in obese and non-obese subjects. Neither customary loading control proteins GAPDH and TBB5 nor CALX are adequate standards in differential expression studies on adipose tissue. The use of the proposed reference proteins will facilitate the adequate analysis of proteins differentially expressed in the context of obesity, an aim difficult to achieve before this study.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GAPDH protein] and [CALX protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of any interaction between GAPDH protein and CALX protein. The passage discusses these proteins only in the context of their suitability as reference standards for protein expression studies in adipose tissue. Specifically, the text states that "Neither customary loading control proteins GAPDH and TBB5 nor CALX are adequate standards in differential expression studies on adipose tissue." This information suggests that both GAPDH and CALX are mentioned as potential reference proteins, but it does not indicate any interaction between them.  The low confidence level is assigned because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, the passage does not provide exhaustive information about these proteins, leaving open the possibility that they might interact in ways not mentioned in this specific study.
247295 2A2440486 2A2544472	B2M	FTL	[INST]Context: [PMID: 22355776 Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with a poorly defined genetic landscape, which poses a major challenge in diagnosis and treatment. By massively parallel mRNA sequencing, we obtained 1.2 billion reads from 17 individual human tissues belonging to TNBC, Non-TNBC, and HER2-positive breast cancers and defined their comprehensive digital transcriptome for the first time. Surprisingly, we identified a high number of novel and unannotated transcripts, revealing the global breast cancer transcriptomic adaptations. Comparative transcriptomic analyses elucidated differentially expressed transcripts between the three breast cancer groups, identifying several new modulators of breast cancer. Our study also identified common transcriptional regulatory elements, such as highly abundant primary transcripts, including osteonectin, RACK1, calnexin, calreticulin, FTL, and B2M, and 'genomic hotspots' enriched in primary transcripts between the three groups.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [B2M protein] and [FTL protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone."

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence.   Explanation: The context provided does not explicitly state or suggest any direct interaction between B2M protein and FTL protein. Both proteins are mentioned together in a list of "common transcriptional regulatory elements" and "highly abundant primary transcripts" found across different breast cancer groups. However, being listed together does not necessarily imply an interaction between these proteins.  The text states: "Our study also identified common transcriptional regulatory elements, such as highly abundant primary transcripts, including osteonectin, RACK1, calnexin, calreticulin, FTL, and B2M..."  This suggests that B2M and FTL are both highly expressed in breast cancer tissues, but it does not provide any information about their potential interaction. They are simply part of a group of transcripts that are commonly abundant across different types of breast cancer.  Given the limited information provided and the lack of any statement suggesting an interaction between these two proteins, we cannot conclude that they interact. However, the confidence is low because the text does not explicitly state that they do not interact either, and there could potentially be undisclosed interactions not mentioned in this specific context.
459489 2A2651446 2A2601220	macrophage migration inhibitory factor	interleukin-6	[INST]Context: [PMID: 15593466 Effects of preinjury administration of corticosteroids on pseudointimal hyperplasia and cytokine response in a rat model of balloon aortic injury. Restenosis occurs in approximately one-third of patients with coronary or peripheral vascular disease who undergo balloon angioplasty or a surgical bypass procedure primarily because of the development of pseudointimal hyperplasia . Corticosteroids were effective in suppressing pseudointimal hyperplasia in several experimental studies, but no clinical studies have been reported. To resolve this discrepancy, we studied the effects of preinjury administration of several doses of methylprednisolone at targeted times in a rat model of balloon aortic injury. Rats were given either no treatment or an intravenous injection of methylprednisolone (0.5, 5.0, 50, or 500 mg/kg) 2 hours before aortic injury. Four hours later interleukin-6, IL-10, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor concentrations in serum and tissue of injured aortas were assessed. Compared with results in controls, methylprednisolone at a dose of 5 mg/kg significantly inhibited increases in plasma and tissue levels of interleukin-6 and significantly reduced the pseudointimal area, pseudointimal/medial area ratio, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen index in injured vessels. Administration of methylprednisolone had no significant effect on the IL-10 or migration inhibitory factor level. Thus in a rat model of balloon aortic injury, preinjury administration of methylprednisolone 5 mg/kg mitigated the development of pseudointimal hyperplasia and cell proliferation and suppressed the postinjury increase in serum and tissue interleukin-6 concentrations. These results suggest that there is an appropriate dosage as well as appropriate timing for methylprednisolone administration to suppress pseudointimal hyperplasia. From MeSH: Rats.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [macrophage migration inhibitory factor protein] and [interleukin-6 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence  Based on the provided context, there is no clear evidence of interaction between macrophage migration inhibitory factor protein and interleukin-6 protein. The study mentions both proteins, but they are discussed separately in relation to the effects of methylprednisolone administration.  The context states that methylprednisolone significantly inhibited increases in interleukin-6 levels in both plasma and tissue. However, it had no significant effect on the migration inhibitory factor level. This suggests that these two proteins are responding differently to the treatment, rather than interacting with each other.  While both proteins are part of the cytokine response studied in this experiment, the text does not indicate any direct interaction or relationship between them. They appear to be independent markers being measured to assess the effects of methylprednisolone on the inflammatory response following balloon aortic injury.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction, the study does not explicitly state that these proteins do not interact. It's possible that there could be some indirect or unstudied relationship between them in this context.
340788 2A2742431 2A2742201	PSMB7	PSMB10	[INST]Context: [PMID: 27659694 Expression of immunoproteasome genes is regulated by cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors in human cancers. Based on transcriptomic analyses of thousands of samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we report that expression of constitutive proteasome genes (PSMB5, PSMB6, PSMB7) and immunoproteasome genes (PSMB8, PSMB9, PSMB10) is increased in most cancer types. In breast cancer, expression of immunoproteasome genes was determined by the abundance of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and high expression of immunoproteasome genes was associated with longer survival. In contrast, immunoproteasome upregulation in acute myeloid leukemia was a cell-intrinsic feature that was not associated with longer survival. Expression of immunoproteasome genes in acute myeloid leukemia was IFN-independent, correlated with the methylation status of immunoproteasome genes, and was particularly high in acute myeloid leukemia with an M5 phenotype and/or MLL rearrangement. Notably, PSMB8 inhibition led to accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and cell death in IPhigh but not IPlow acute myeloid leukemia cells. However, in M5 acute myeloid leukemia, immunoproteasome genes were primarily co-regulated with genes involved in cell metabolism and proliferation, mitochondrial activity and stress responses. We conclude that M5 acute myeloid leukemia cells can upregulate immunoproteasome genes in a cell-intrinsic manner in order to resist cell stress.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [PSMB7 protein] and [PSMB10 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence  The context does not provide any specific information about direct interaction between PSMB7 protein and PSMB10 protein. While both are mentioned in the text, they are discussed in different contexts:  1. PSMB7 is mentioned as one of the constitutive proteasome genes (PSMB5, PSMB6, PSMB7). 2. PSMB10 is mentioned as one of the immunoproteasome genes (PSMB8, PSMB9, PSMB10).  The text discusses how the expression of these genes is increased in most cancer types, but it does not indicate any direct interaction between PSMB7 and PSMB10 proteins. They appear to be part of different proteasome complexes (constitutive and immunoproteasome, respectively) rather than interacting partners.  The medium confidence level is assigned because while there is no explicit mention of interaction, the proteins are part of related cellular machinery (proteasomes), and there could potentially be some indirect functional relationship not mentioned in this specific context.
663366 2A2457399 2A2905345	MCP-3	TRAIL	[INST]Context: [PMID: 24506344 Acute and chronic immune biomarker changes during interferon/ribavirin treatment in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Chronic viral infections lead to persistent immune activation, which is alleviated by eradicating or suppressing the infection. To understand the effects of interferon treatment on immune system activation by chronic infections, we evaluated kinetic patterns of a broad spectrum of serum biomarkers during HCV treatment in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. HCV viral load and 50 biomarkers were analysed at baseline and 27 time points during pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin treatment of 12 HIV/HCV co-infected patients. We evaluated biomarker changes from baseline for each time point and biomarker correlations with clinical parameters, treatment response and liver histopathology. IL-1alpha, IL-12p40, IL-1RA, IP-10, MIG, MIP-1alpha/1beta, HGF, sCD40L, TRAIL and leptin increased in the first day. IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-10, GROalpha, IL-8, MCP-3, IL-4 and M-CSF peaked later during week 1. IL-1alpha, HGF, IP-10, MIP-1alpha, TRAIL, sCD40L, IL-10, IL-12p70, MCP-3, FGFb, ENA-78, TGF-beta, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-15, IL-7 and PDGF-BB decreased below baseline over the course of treatment. Higher BMI, baseline HCV viral load and leptin levels were associated with lack of sustained virologic response. ENA-78 was associated with sustained viral response. Positive correlations were found between liver inflammation and baseline CD4 count, sVCAM and HGF; Liver steatosis, BMI and leptin. Our findings suggest interferon-alpha and ribavirin treatment initially increases levels of several biomarkers, but eventually leads to a decline in many immune markers. These findings shed light on the relationship between IFN treatment and immune activation by chronic viral infections, such as HCV.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [MCP-3 protein] and [TRAIL protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no clear indication that MCP-3 protein and TRAIL protein directly interact with each other. The passage mentions both proteins, but they are listed among several other biomarkers that show changes during interferon/ribavirin treatment in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.  The text states that both MCP-3 and TRAIL increase in the first day of treatment, along with other biomarkers. However, this parallel behavior does not necessarily imply a direct interaction between the two proteins. They are simply responding similarly to the treatment.  Later in the text, it mentions that MCP-3 peaked later during week 1, while TRAIL decreased below baseline over the course of treatment. This different behavior over time further suggests that these proteins are not directly interacting but rather responding independently to the treatment.  Without additional information explicitly stating an interaction between MCP-3 and TRAIL, we cannot conclude that they interact based solely on the provided context. The medium confidence level is assigned because while there's no evidence of interaction, the context doesn't provide exhaustive information about all possible protein interactions.
37117 2A2936581 2A2865279	Vim	SMA	[INST]Context: [PMID: 31860964 RATIONALE: Primary schwannoma is extremely rare in the trachea, and its optimal treatment has not yet been established. Window resection was usually utilized for selected patients with trachea invasion by thyroid carcinoma, but video-assisted thoracoscopic window resection for trachea schwannoma has not been reported previously. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 23-year-old woman was admitted to hospital due to dyspnea, coughing and wheezing that had persisted for 2 months with aggravation for 1 week. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated cells labeled with Vim (+), S-100 (+), SOX-10 (+), SMA (-), CK (-). Histopathological examinations showed that the mass was a schwannoma. Finally, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic window resection of trachea. OUTCOMES: The patient recovered rapidly and no recurrence was observed over 6 months of follow-up. LESSONS: The treatment of tracheal schwannoma depends on the characteristics of tumor and the condition of patient. Tracheal window resection by video-assisted thoracoscopy is beneficial for some appropriate patients with a small and sessile tumor.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Vim protein] and [SMA protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no indication of any interaction between Vim protein and SMA protein. The text simply lists these proteins among others as part of immunohistochemical staining results, stating "Vim (+), S-100 (+), SOX-10 (+), SMA (-)". This suggests that Vim was present in the cells while SMA was not, but it does not imply any interaction between these proteins.  The low confidence is due to the limited information provided about these specific proteins in the given context. The text is primarily focused on describing a case of tracheal schwannoma and its treatment, rather than discussing protein interactions. Without more detailed information about the relationship between Vim and SMA proteins, it's not possible to definitively rule out any potential interaction, even though none is mentioned or implied in this context.

Ginkgo biloba L. leaves (GBLs), as widely used plant extract sources, significantly improve cognitive, learning and memory function in patients with dementia. However, few studies have been conducted on the specific mechanism of Neurodegenerative diseases . In this study, network pharmacology was employed to elucidate potential mechanism of GBLs in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Potential targets of GBLs were integrated with disease targets, and intersection targets were exactly the potential action targets of GBLs for treating neurodegenerative diseases; These components may also affect 120 metabolic pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, by regulating 147 targets, including AKT1, ALB, HSP90AA1, PTGS2, MMP9, EGFR and APP.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence to suggest that HSP90AA1 protein and EGFR protein may interact or be involved in related pathways in the context of Ginkgo biloba L. leaves' (GBLs) effects on neurodegenerative diseases. The passage states:  "These components may also affect 120 metabolic pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, by regulating 147 targets, including AKT1, ALB, HSP90AA1, PTGS2, MMP9, EGFR and APP."  Both HSP90AA1 and EGFR are listed among the 147 targets regulated by components of GBLs, and they are mentioned in the same context of affecting metabolic pathways. This suggests that these proteins may be part of the same regulatory network or signaling cascade involved in the mechanism of GBLs in treating neurodegenerative diseases.  However, the text does not explicitly state a direct interaction between HSP90AA1 and EGFR. The confidence level is medium because while there is a strong implication of a functional relationship between these proteins in the context of GBLs' effects, the exact nature of their interaction is not specified, and further research would be needed to confirm a direct interaction between them.

Restricting transgene expression to maturing erythroid cells can reduce the risk for activating oncogenes in hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny, yet take advantage of their robust protein synthesis machinery for high-level protein production. This study sought to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of reprogramming erythroid cells for production of a lysosomal enzyme, alpha-L-iduronidase . An erythroid-specific hybrid promoter provided inducible iduronidase expression and release during in vitro erythroid differentiation in murine erythroleukemia cells, resulting in phenotypical cross-correction in an enzyme-deficient lymphoblastoid cell line derived from patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). Stable and higher than normal plasma iduronidase levels were achieved in vivo in primary and secondary MPS I chimeras for at least 9 months after transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells transduced with the erythroid-specific IDUA-containing lentiviral vector . Moreover, long-term metabolic correction was demonstrated by normalized urinary glycosaminoglycan accumulation in all treated MPS I mice. Notably, neurological function and brain pathology were significantly improved in MPS I mice by erythroid-derived, higher than normal peripheral iduronidase protein. These data demonstrate that late-stage erythroid cells, transduced with a tissue-specific lentiviral vector, can deliver a lysosomal enzyme continuously at supraphysiological levels to the bloodstream and can correct the disease phenotype in both viscera and CNS of MPS I mice. This approach provides a paradigm for the utilization of RBC precursors as a depot for efficient and potentially safer systemic delivery of nonsecreted proteins by ex vivo HSC gene transfer. Mice.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [alpha-L-iduronidase protein] and [MPS I protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence.   Explanation: The context provided clearly indicates an interaction between alpha-L-iduronidase protein and the MPS I (mucopolysaccharidosis type I) condition. Specifically:  1. Alpha-L-iduronidase is described as a lysosomal enzyme that is deficient in patients with MPS I.  2. The study aims to evaluate the feasibility of producing alpha-L-iduronidase to treat MPS I.  3. When alpha-L-iduronidase is produced and released by reprogrammed erythroid cells, it leads to phenotypical cross-correction in enzyme-deficient cells derived from MPS I patients.  4. Increased levels of alpha-L-iduronidase in MPS I mice resulted in metabolic correction, as evidenced by normalized urinary glycosaminoglycan accumulation.  5. The presence of higher than normal levels of alpha-L-iduronidase in the peripheral blood of MPS I mice led to improvements in neurological function and brain pathology.  These points clearly demonstrate that alpha-L-iduronidase protein interacts with the MPS I condition by correcting the enzyme deficiency and alleviating disease symptoms. Therefore, we can confidently say that there is a direct interaction between alpha-L-iduronidase protein and the MPS I protein (or more accurately, the lack thereof in MPS I condition).

We analyzed a group of large mammalian microarray datasets including the NCI60 cancer cell line panel, a leukemia tumor panel, and a phorbol ester induction time course as well as human and mouse tissue panels. Twelve housekeeping genes commonly used as controls in classical expression studies (including GAPD, ACTB, B2M, TUBA, G6PD, LDHA, and HPRT) show considerable variability of expression both within and across microarray datasets. We confirm these results with an analysis of variance in a controlled mouse dataset, showing the extent of variability in gene expression across tissues.

Explanation: The context provided does not indicate any direct interaction between GAPD protein and B2M protein. The passage mentions these genes (along with others) as examples of commonly used housekeeping genes in expression studies. However, the text does not describe any functional or physical interaction between these specific proteins.  The main point of the context is to highlight that these housekeeping genes, including GAPD and B2M, show considerable variability in expression across different datasets and tissues, contrary to the expectation that they maintain stable expression levels. This variability is discussed in terms of their individual expression patterns, not in terms of how they interact with each other.  Without additional information specifically addressing the relationship between GAPD and B2M proteins, we cannot conclude that they interact. The low confidence level is assigned because while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, it's possible that such interactions could exist but are not mentioned in this particular excerpt.
403742 2A2592161 2A2736893	APG2	PRDX1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 33053689 Sequenced Combinations of Cisplatin and Selected Phytochemicals towards Overcoming Drug Resistance in Ovarian Tumour Models. In the present study, cisplatin, artemisinin, and oleanolic acid were evaluated alone, and in combination, on human ovarian A2780, A2780ZD0473R, and A2780cisR cancer cell lines, with the aim of overcoming cisplatin resistance and side effects. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT reduction assay. MALDI TOF/TOF MS/MS and 2-DE gel electrophoresis were used to identify protein biomarkers in ovarian cancer and to evaluate combination effects. Moreover, 49 proteins differently expressed by 2 ___ fold were: CYPA, EIF5A1, Op18, p18, LDHB, P4HB, HSP7C, GRP94, ERp57, mortalin, IMMT, CLIC1, NM23, PSA3,1433Z, and HSP90B were down-regulated, whereas hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2/B1, EF2, GOT1, EF1A1, VIME, BIP, ATP5H, APG2, VINC, KPYM, RAN, PSA7, TPI, PGK1, ACTG and VDAC1 were up-regulated, while TCPA, TCPH, TCPB, PRDX6, EF1G, ATPA, ENOA, PRDX1, MCM7, GBLP, PSAT, Hop, EFTU, PGAM1, SERA and CAH2 were not-expressed in A2780cisR cells. The proteins were found to play critical roles in cell cycle regulation, metabolism, and biosynthetic processes and drug resistance and detoxification. Results indicate that appropriately sequenced combinations of cisplatin with artemisinin and oleanolic acid may provide a means to reduce side effects and circumvent platinum resistance.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [APG2 protein] and [PRDX1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no clear indication of a direct interaction between APG2 protein and PRDX1 protein. The passage lists various proteins that were differentially expressed in A2780cisR cells compared to other cell lines, but it does not describe any specific interactions between these proteins.  APG2 is mentioned as being up-regulated in A2780cisR cells, while PRDX1 is listed among the proteins that were not expressed in these cells. However, the mere fact that they are differentially expressed does not necessarily imply an interaction between them.  The low confidence in this answer stems from the limited information provided about these specific proteins and their potential relationships. While they may be part of broader cellular processes affected by cisplatin resistance, there is no explicit evidence in the given context to suggest a direct interaction between APG2 and PRDX1.
468971 2A2430998 2A2897320	ATF4	p62	[INST]Context: [PMID: 30535464 Inhibition of autophagy enhances adenosine___induced apoptosis in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells. In cancer research, autophagy acts as a double___edged sword: it increases cell viability or induces cell apoptosis depending upon the cell context and functional status. Recent studies have shown that adenosine has cytotoxic effects in many tumors. However, the role of autophagy in Ado___induced apoptosis is still poorly understood. In the present study, Ado___induced apoptotic death and autophagy in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells was investigated and the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis was identified. In the present study, it was demonstrated that adenosine inhibited HepG2 cell growth in a time___ and concentration___dependent manner and activated endoplasmic reticulum stress, as indicated by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, the increased mRNA and protein levels of GRP78/BiP, PERK, ATF4, CHOP, cleaved caspase___3, cytochrome c and the loss of mitochon-drial membrane potential (deltapsim). Adenosine also induced autophagic flux, revealed by the increased expression of the autophagy marker microtubule___associated protein 1 light chain 3___II, Beclin___1, autophagosomes, and the degradation of p62, as revealed by western blot analysis and macrophage___derived chemokine staining. Blocking autophagy using LY294002 notably entrenched Ado___induced growth inhibition and cell apoptosis, as demonstrated with the increased expression of cytochrome c and p62, and the decreased expression of light chain 3___ii. Conversely, the autophagy inducer rapamycin alleviated Ado___induced apoptosis and markedly increased the deltapsim. Moreover, knockdown of AMPK with si___AMPK partially abolished Ado___induced ULK1 activation and mTOR inhibition, and thus reinforced CHOP expression and Ado___induced apoptosis. These results indicated that Ado___induced endoplasmic reticulum stress resulted in apoptosis and autophagy concurrently. The AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway played a protective role in the apoptotic procession. Inhibition of autophagy may effectively enhance the anticancer effect of adenosine in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [ATF4 protein] and [p62 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a direct interaction between ATF4 protein and p62 protein. The passage discusses both proteins, but in separate contexts:  1. ATF4 is mentioned as part of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, along with other proteins like GRP78/BiP, PERK, and CHOP.  2. p62 is discussed in the context of autophagy, where its degradation is used as an indicator of autophagic flux.  While both proteins are involved in cellular processes affected by adenosine treatment, there is no information provided about them directly interacting or influencing each other's function. The text does not suggest any relationship between ATF4 and p62 beyond their involvement in separate cellular responses to adenosine.  However, I've assigned a medium confidence level because there's always a possibility of indirect interactions or relationships that are not explicitly stated in the given context. Complex cellular processes often involve intricate networks of protein interactions, and without more specific information, we cannot completely rule out a potential connection between these two proteins.
36257 2A2936581 2A2764298	vimentin	KRAS	[INST]Context: [PMID: 21285251 DCAMKL-1 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human pancreatic cells through a miR-200a-dependent mechanism. Pancreatic cancer is an exceptionally aggressive disease in great need of more effective therapeutic options. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition plays a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis, and there is a gain of stem cell properties during epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Here we report increased expression of the putative pancreatic stem cell marker DCAMKL-1 in an established KRAS transgenic mouse model of pancreatic cancer and in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Colocalization of DCAMKL-1 with vimentin, a marker of mesenchymal lineage, along with 14-3-3 sigma was observed within premalignant PanIN lesions that arise in the mouse model. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of DCAMKL-1 in human pancreatic cancer cells induced microRNA miR-200a, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition inhibitor, along with downregulation of EMT-associated transcription factors ZEB1, ZEB2, Snail, Slug, and Twist. Furthermore, DCAMKL-1 knockdown resulted in downregulation of c-Myc and KRAS through a let-7a microRNA-dependent mechanism, and downregulation of Notch-1 through a miR-144 microRNA-dependent mechanism. These findings illustrate direct regulatory links between DCAMKL-1, microRNAs, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic cancer. Moreover, they demonstrate a functional role for DCAMKL-1 in pancreatic cancer. Together, our results rationalize DCAMKL-1 as a therapeutic target for eradicating pancreatic cancers. Mice.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [vimentin protein] and [KRAS protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: The provided context does not explicitly mention any direct interaction between vimentin protein and KRAS protein. While both proteins are mentioned in the text, they appear in different contexts:  1. Vimentin is mentioned as a marker of mesenchymal lineage, which colocalizes with DCAMKL-1 in premalignant PanIN lesions.  2. KRAS is mentioned in two contexts:    a. As part of an established KRAS transgenic mouse model of pancreatic cancer.    b. As being downregulated through a let-7a microRNA-dependent mechanism when DCAMKL-1 is knocked down.  The text does not provide any information about a direct interaction or relationship between vimentin and KRAS proteins. They are mentioned in separate contexts related to different aspects of pancreatic cancer research.  However, given the complexity of cellular signaling pathways and the potential for indirect interactions, it's possible that these proteins could be indirectly related in pancreatic cancer progression. This is why I've assigned a low confidence to the "NO" answer, as there might be connections not explicitly stated in the given context.
682503 2A2457284 2A2592321	eotaxin	hsp27	[INST]Context: [PMID: 11576227 Changes in gene expression in macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach. We investigated the changes which occur in gene expression in the human macrophage cell line, THP1, at 1, 6 and 12 hr following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The analysis was carried out at the transcriptome level, using microarrays consisting of 375 human genes generally thought to be involved in immunoregulation, and at the proteomic level, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Most of these genes encoded proteins involved in cell migration and homing, including the chemokines interleukin -8, osteopontin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, regulated on activation, normal, T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), MIP-1beta, MIP-3alpha, myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor-1, pulmonary and activation regulated chemokine, growth regulated gene-beta, GRO-gamma, MCP-2, I-309, and the T helper 2 and eosinophil-attracting chemokine, eotaxin. Other genes involved in cell migration which were up-regulated included the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor Flk-1, the chemokine receptor CCR3, and the cell adhesion molecules vesicular cell adhesion molecule-1 and integrin a3. In addition to the chemokine response, genes encoding the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta (showing a 433-fold induction), IL-2 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, were also found to be induced at 6 and/or 12 hr. The heat-shock protein hsp27 was found to be down-regulated following infection. We also identified a mycobacterial protein, the product of the atpD gene (thought to be involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic pH) in the infected macrophage extracts.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [eotaxin protein] and [hsp27 protein] interact with each other?

Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between eotaxin protein and hsp27 protein. The passage mentions both proteins, but in different contexts:  1. Eotaxin is listed among the chemokines that were up-regulated in macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  2. Hsp27 (heat-shock protein 27) is mentioned as being down-regulated following infection.  These proteins are not described as interacting with each other or having any related functions in the context provided. They are simply listed as part of the overall gene expression changes observed in the study.   The low confidence is due to the limited information provided about these specific proteins in the given context. While there is no evidence of interaction, the study focused on a broad range of gene expression changes, and it's possible that more detailed analysis could reveal some indirect relationship between these proteins that is not mentioned in this summary.

The aim of the present study was to determine the occurrence of seven virulence determinants in Enterococcus faecium clinical blood culture isolates over a 6-year period and to investigate possible correlations between virulence and antibiotic resistance. Two hundred and sixty-three isolates were screened for the presence of genes coding for aggregation substance, cytolysin, collagen-binding protein (ace), Enterococcusfaecalis endocarditis antigen (efaA(fs)), enterococcal surface protein (esp(fm)), gelatinase and hyaluronidase (hyl(fm)) by polymerase chain reaction.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between cytolysin protein and collagen-binding protein (ace). The study discusses screening for the presence of various virulence determinants in Enterococcus faecium isolates, including genes coding for cytolysin and collagen-binding protein, but it does not describe any direct interaction between these two proteins.  The context focuses on the prevalence of these virulence factors and their potential correlation with antibiotic resistance, particularly noting a significant correlation between esp(fm) (enterococcal surface protein) and resistance to certain antibiotics. However, no such relationship or interaction is mentioned for cytolysin and collagen-binding protein.  Given the lack of specific information about the interaction between these two proteins, I cannot confidently state that they interact. However, since the study does not explicitly state that they do not interact, and because they are both virulence factors in the same organism, there is a possibility of some indirect interaction or relationship that is not mentioned in this context. This is why I've assigned a low confidence to the "NO" answer.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence   Explanation:  Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that renin protein and hCG protein interact with each other. The text mentions both renin substrate (angiotensinogen) and hCG, but only in the context of their cross-reactivity with labeled erythropoietin. Specifically, the passage states that both of these substances have less than 0.01% cross-reactivity with the labeled erythropoietin used in the study.  The context does not provide any information about direct interactions between renin protein and hCG protein. They are simply listed together as examples of substances that do not significantly bind to the erythropoietin receptors being studied.

It's possible that these proteins could interact in ways not mentioned in this specific study.
103030 2A2704682 2A2778324	TP53	BAP1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 33209614 SMO mutations confer poor prognosis in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Background: Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive tumor but approximately 12% of patients survive more than 3 years. Hedgehog (Hh) is one emerging pathway. We compared the biological profiles of patients with different survival, investigating the most frequently altered genes, including the Hh pathway. Methods: We analyzed 56 malignant pleural mesothelioma. A 36-month overall survival cut-off divided patients into 32 normo and 24 long (LS) survivors. We used next generation sequencing to test 21 genes, immunohistochemistry to evaluate SMO expression. Mutation differences between normo and LS and their associations with clinical features were analysed by Fisher's test, overall survival with the Kaplan-Meier method and its association with mutations by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Clinical features were similar in both groups. Eighteen out of 56 patients (32%) were wild-type for the genes analysed. At least five had mutations in BAP1, NF2, TP53, SMO and PTCH1 with no significant differences between the groups except for SMO. SMO, a member of the Hh pathway, was mutated only in normo (15.6%) and only SMO mutations were significantly associated with poor prognosis at univariate (HR =4.36, 95% CI: 2.32-8.18, P<0.0001) and multivariate (HR =9.2, 95% CI: 3.0-28.4, P=0.0001) analysis. All SMO mutated patients expressed high protein levels. SMO may be a therapeutic target but this needs to be confirmed in a prospective trial.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [TP53 protein] and [BAP1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone."

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between TP53 protein and BAP1 protein. The text simply lists these genes among others that had mutations in at least five patients:  "At least five had mutations in BAP1, NF2, TP53, SMO and PTCH1 with no significant differences between the groups except for SMO."  This statement only indicates that mutations were found in these genes, but it does not suggest any interaction between the proteins they encode. The focus of the study appears to be more on the role of SMO mutations in prognosis, rather than on interactions between TP53 and BAP1.  Given the limited information provided about these specific proteins and the lack of any statement suggesting their interaction, we cannot conclude that they interact based on this context alone. However, it's important to note that the absence of evidence for interaction in this specific text does not necessarily mean these proteins do not interact in other contexts or studies. The confidence is low because while there's no evidence of interaction here, our knowledge is limited to just this particular study's focus and findings.

Total protein lysates after sirolimus treatment were used to identify significantly regulated proteins and phosphorylated proteins by 2-DE and Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Incubation with 2.5 micromol/l sirolimus resulted in a approximately 70% inhibition of cell proliferation. Cells incubated with 2.5 micromol/l for 30 min showed a differential phosphorylation pattern with one higher (TCPQ) and six lower phosphorylation signals (TBA1B, VIME, HNRPD, ENPL, SEPT9, PLSL). On investigating the differential protein expression, five proteins were found to be up-regulated (ECHB, PSB3, MTDC, LDHB and NDKA) and four were down-regulated (EHD1, AATC, LMNB1 and MDHC). Nine of these differentially regulated proteins/phosphoproteins (TCPQ, TBA1B, VIME, HNRPD, ENPL, ECHB, PSB3, LDHB and LMNB1) showed significant interaction potential, through binding protein YWHAZ using MINT software. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time the simultaneous early influence of sirolimus on phosphorylation status and on protein expression in the total proteome of CCRF-CEM T lymphoblasts and predict that 56% of the proteins interact with each other, highlighting significance of these results.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [VIME protein] and [MDHC protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between VIME (vimentin) protein and MDHC (malate dehydrogenase, cytoplasmic) protein. The study focuses on the effects of sirolimus on protein expression and phosphorylation in T-lymphoblast cells, but it does not specifically mention any interaction between these two proteins.  The context states that VIME showed lower phosphorylation signals after sirolimus treatment, while MDHC was found to be down-regulated in protein expression. However, these changes are reported independently, and there is no indication of a direct interaction between the two proteins.  Furthermore, when discussing protein interactions, the study mentions that nine of the differentially regulated proteins/phosphoproteins showed significant interaction potential through binding protein YWHAZ. Neither VIME nor MDHC are listed among these nine proteins.  Given the lack of specific information about the interaction between VIME and MDHC, and the fact that they are not mentioned together in any context that would suggest interaction, I cannot conclude that they interact with each other based on this information. However, the confidence is low because the study does not exhaustively explore all possible protein interactions, and there might be interactions that were not detected or reported in this particular experiment.
454585 2A2537221 2A2748379	alpha-fetoprotein	phosphatase and tensin homolog	[INST]Context: [PMID: 28411180 Coexpression of SALL4 with histone deacetylase 1 and/or histone deacetylase 2 is associated with underexpression of PTEN and poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. A previous study has demonstrated that SALL4 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase complex, which contains histone deacetylase 1 and histone deacetylase 2 . In this study, we investigated the expression status of SALL4, histone deacetylase 1, and histone deacetylase 2 and their relationship with phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) by immunohistochemical analysis of the posthepatectomy specimens of 135 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated at our hospital. Ninety-two frozen samples were subjected to quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect the messenger RNA levels of PTEN. Seventy-six (56%) of 135 patients were positive for SALL4, and this group had a higher prevalence of hepatitis B antigen, a higher value of alpha-fetoprotein and protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKAII) and poor histologic differentiation. High histone deacetylase 1 expression (51%) was correlated with a poor histologic differentiation and a poor prognosis. High histone deacetylase 2 expression (46%) was associated with a higher prevalence of hepatitis B antigen positivity, a poor histologic differentiation and higher prevalence of vascular invasion, and a lower 5-year survival rate. Coexpression of SALL4 with histone deacetylase 1 and/or histone deacetylase 2 was correlated with underexpression of PTEN. Moreover, multivariable analysis revealed that coexpression of SALL4 with histone deacetylase 1 and/or histone deacetylase 2 was predictive of an unfavorable prognosis. Our data thus suggested that the combination of SALL4, histone deacetylase 1, and histone deacetylase 2 may provide a potential target for molecular therapy.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [alpha-fetoprotein protein] and [phosphatase and tensin homolog protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between alpha-fetoprotein protein and phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN). The text mentions both proteins, but they are discussed in separate contexts:  1. Alpha-fetoprotein is mentioned as a value that is higher in patients who are positive for SALL4.  2. PTEN is discussed in relation to its underexpression when SALL4 is coexpressed with histone deacetylase 1 and/or histone deacetylase 2.  The text does not describe any direct interaction, relationship, or combined effect between alpha-fetoprotein and PTEN. They appear to be separate markers or factors associated with different aspects of hepatocellular carcinoma.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, the text doesn't explicitly state that these proteins do not interact. It's possible that there could be some undescribed relationship between them in the broader context of hepatocellular carcinoma that is not mentioned in this specific study.
76171 2A2871962 2A2439242	SRSF5	ATRX	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34430595 Identifying a possible new target for diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis through bioinformatics and clinical sample analysis. Background: Postmenopausal osteoporosis, a common yet chronic systemic metabolic disease, has become a major public health problem due to life expectancy increasing around the world. The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts, and the differentiation of circulating monocyte cells into osteoclasts, play an important role in the balance of bone metabolism. However, when both undergo pathological changes, it can lead to abnormalities, resulting in osteoporosis. This study aims to explore a new biomarker for postmenopausal osteoporosis, thereby providing a new entry point for bioinformatic research into the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Methods: Using the Gene Expression Omnibus database, microarray analysis was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes in mesenchymal stem cells and monocytes in both postmenopausal osteoporosis patients and a healthy control group. Results: We identified 45 high-expression and 26 low-expression genes through the study, all of which underwent pathway enrichment analysis. This enrichment was observed in the cell cycle regulation, osteoclast differentiation, tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, and RNA transport. The top 10 hub genes of the protein-protein interaction network were SF3B1, SRSF5, FUBP1, SRSF3, TIA1, KHSRP, LUC7L3, PNN, SRC, and ATRX. Comparing the mesenchymal stem cells and monocytes between the postmenopausal osteoporosis patients and the healthy control group, we noted that the expression of the above genes differed greatly. Conclusions: Through bioinformatic analysis and clinical specimen validation, our study provides a new way for exploring the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Most importantly, it suggests that the hub genes, SF3B1, SRSF5, FUBP1, KHSRP, and SRC, may become new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for diagnosing and treating postmenopausal osteoporosis in the future.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SRSF5 protein] and [ATRX protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit evidence of direct interaction between SRSF5 protein and ATRX protein. While both proteins are mentioned in the list of top 10 hub genes identified in the protein-protein interaction network, the context does not provide any specific information about their interaction with each other.  The study focuses on identifying differentially expressed genes in mesenchymal stem cells and monocytes in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients compared to healthy controls. SRSF5 and ATRX are listed among the hub genes, but there is no mention of a specific interaction between these two proteins.  The medium confidence level is assigned because while there is no direct evidence of interaction, both proteins are part of the same protein-protein interaction network, which suggests they may be indirectly related in the context of postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, without more specific information about their relationship, we cannot conclude that they directly interact with each other.
362893 2A2520685 2A2529968	epidermal growth factor receptor	Enhancer of zeste homolog-2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34321957 INTRODUCTION: Gallbladder cancer exhibits striking variability in the global rates, reaching epidemic levels for some regions and ethnicities. The basis of its variability resides in differences in environmental exposure and intrinsic genetic predisposition to carcinogenesis. There is little information present regarding genetic and molecular alterations in gall bladder cancer . We, therefore, have evaluated the molecular marker expression in gall bladder cancer and studied their correlation with clinicopathological staging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted on newly diagnosed gall bladder cancer patients from July 2017 to July 2020. After complete staging workup, the gall bladder cancer biopsy samples paraffin block was tested for molecular markers estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, p53, p16, Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Hestrogen receptor 2-neu), Survivin, Enhancer of zeste homolog-2, and Cyclooxygenase-2 expression by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Fifty newly diagnosed patients of carcinoma gall bladder were included in the present study. Age was ranged from 29 - 69 years (mean 53.42). p53 was the most common positive marker in 74% of patients, survivin in 58%, cyclooxygenase-2 in 44%, and p16 in 42% whereas Her 2 neu and EZH-2 were positive in 16% of patients each. None of the patients of gall bladder cancer were estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor positive. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows the expression of molecular markers Her2 neu, p53, p16, survivin, cyclooxygenase-2, and EZH-2 in gall bladder cancer. Now the time has come, and it is also the need of the day to establish early biomarkers of this highly lethal malignancy.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [epidermal growth factor receptor protein] and [Enhancer of zeste homolog-2 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between epidermal growth factor receptor protein (Her2-neu) and Enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH-2) protein. The study merely reports on the expression of these molecular markers in gallbladder cancer samples, along with several other markers. Both Her2-neu and EZH-2 are mentioned to be positive in 16% of patients each, but this does not indicate any interaction between the two proteins.  The study focuses on evaluating the expression of various molecular markers in gallbladder cancer and their correlation with clinicopathological staging. It does not discuss any functional relationships or interactions between the markers themselves. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, we cannot conclude that these two proteins interact with each other.  The low confidence is due to the limited information provided about these specific proteins and the lack of any discussion about protein interactions in the given context. It's possible that these proteins do interact in some way, but such information is not present in the given text.
64906 2A2547785 2A2907654	glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase	triosephosphate isomerase	[INST]Context: [PMID: 25091895 Bone morphogenic protein-4-induced oxidant signaling via protein carbonylation for endothelial dysfunction. The increased expression of bone morphogenic protein-4 under hyperglycemic and diabetic conditions mediates the overgeneration of reactive oxygen species to cause endothelial cell dysfunction and apoptosis. Protein carbonylation plays an important role in oxidant signaling through ligand-receptor interactions in vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiac cells, and bronchial smooth muscle cells to trigger different diseases. However, the role of oxidant signaling via protein carbonylation in endothelial dysfunction is unclear. The level of protein carbonylation was higher in renal arteries from diabetic patients than those from nondiabetic subjects. Bone morphogenic protein-4 promoted protein carbonylation, which was followed by decarbonylation or degradation in primary rat aortic endothelial cells. Organ culture of normal C57BL/6J mouse aortas treated with either hydralazine or deferoxamine inhibited the effect of bone morphogenic protein-4 on impairment of acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation . In isolated diabetic db/db mouse aortas, treatment with hydralazine improved the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation while deferoxamine had no effect. BMP-4-induced carbonylated proteins in aortic endothelial cells were successfully identified by a proteomic approach. These proteins have important cellular functions and include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase, alpha-enolase, protein disulfide-isomerase A3, annexin II, 26S protease regulatory subunit, integrin-linked protein kinase, and vimentin. Protein carbonylation induced by bone morphogenic protein-4 was inhibited by bone morphogenic protein-4 antagonist while protein decarbonylation induced by bone morphogenic protein-4 was thiol dependent. The carbonyl signals did not involve 4-hydrononenal and malondialdehyde. The present results suggest that BMP-4- or diabetes-mediated endothelial dysfunction is partly triggered through protein carbonylation and blockade of this metal-catalyzed protein oxidation can be considered as an alternative therapeutic strategy to alleviate diabetic vasculopathy.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of direct interaction between glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein and triosephosphate isomerase protein. These proteins are listed together as part of a group of proteins that were identified as being carbonylated in response to bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP-4) treatment in aortic endothelial cells. The text states:  "BMP-4-induced carbonylated proteins in aortic endothelial cells were successfully identified by a proteomic approach. These proteins have important cellular functions and include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase, alpha-enolase, protein disulfide-isomerase A3, annexin II, 26S protease regulatory subunit, integrin-linked protein kinase, and vimentin."  While both proteins are mentioned in the same context of being carbonylated due to BMP-4 treatment, this does not necessarily imply a direct interaction between them. They are simply listed as part of a group of proteins affected by the same process. Without further information about their functional relationship or physical interaction, we cannot conclude that these two proteins interact with each other based solely on the given context.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction provided, the possibility of interaction cannot be completely ruled out given that both proteins are involved in related metabolic pathways and are affected by the same treatment.
106451 2A2762817 2A2739390	Rab10	Pfn1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 31875436 [Expression and functions of long non-coding RNA actin filament-associated protein 1-antisense RNA1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma]. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the expression and clinical significance of long non-coding RNA actin filament-associated protein 1-antisense RNA1 (AFAP1-AS1) in oral squamous cell carcinoma and its effect on the biobehavior of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of long non-coding rna AFAP1-AS1 in the tumor tissue and matching adjacent normal tissue of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients (n=55), SCC25 cells, and normal oral keratinocyte lines (NOK) cells. The correlation between AFAP1-AS1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients was analyzed. AFAP1-AS1 siRNA was transfected into the SCC25 cells. The expression of the invasion-associated protein, AFAP1, and Rho GTPase family members, was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The expression of AFAP1-AS1 was higher in the oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues than in the NOK cells, and the relative expression of AFAP1-AS1 was higher in the SCC25 cells than in the NOK cells (P<0.001). AFAP1-AS1 expression was associated with the degree of diffe-rentiation, TNM stage, lymphatic metastasis, and poor prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (P<0.05). Patients with a high expression of AFAP1-AS1 had lower survival rates than those with a low expression of AFAP1-AS1 (P<0.05). Moreover, AFAP1-AS1 siRNA upregulated the expression levels of AFAP1, RhoA, Rac2, Rab10, RhoGDI, and Pfn1 but downregulated the expression of RhoC. Immunofluorescence showed that AFAP1-AS1 also reduced the formation of stress filaments in the cytoskeleton and affected the integrity of the actin fila-ment. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of AFAP1-AS1 was high in the oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues and SCC25 cells and is associated with the development and prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma. The knockdown of AFAP1-AS1 might inhibit the proliferation and invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells by regulating the integrity of the actin filament.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Rab10 protein] and [Pfn1 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence   Explanation: The provided context does not explicitly state or imply any direct interaction between Rab10 protein and Pfn1 protein. Both proteins are mentioned together in a list of proteins whose expression levels were upregulated when AFAP1-AS1 was knocked down using siRNA:  "Moreover, AFAP1-AS1 siRNA upregulated the expression levels of AFAP1, RhoA, Rac2, Rab10, RhoGDI, and Pfn1 but downregulated the expression of RhoC."  However, this information alone does not indicate that Rab10 and Pfn1 interact with each other. They are simply listed as proteins affected by the same experimental condition. Without further evidence of a direct relationship or interaction between these two specific proteins, we cannot conclude that they interact.  The confidence level is low because while there's no explicit mention of interaction, the context doesn't provide enough information to completely rule out the possibility of some indirect or unmentioned interaction between these proteins in the broader cellular context.
369878 2A2459092 2A2558984	CD81	HCG	[INST]Context: [PMID: 31136209 Ultrastructural identification of CD9 positive extracellular vesicles released from human embryos and transported through the zona pellucida. However, the secretion of extracellular vesicles from mammalian embryos, especially human, has not been well characterized. Thus, the aim of this study was to 1) identify extracellular vesicles in human preimplantation embryos at different stages of their development using scanning and electron microscopy, and 2) investigate whether extracellular vesicles can cross the zona pellucida and be released from human embryos cultured in vitro. Human oocytes, zygotes, cleavage embryos and blastocysts donated for research were labeled with the tetraspanin EV marker CD9 and analyzed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Embryo culture conditioned media collected 3- and 5-days post fertilization were examined for the presence of extracellular vesicles using electron microscopy. We detected numerous CD9 positive vesicles released from all embryos examined. They were observed on the surface of the plasma membrane, within the perivitelline space as well as throughout the zona pellucida. Interestingly, extracellular vesicles were not seen in the zona pellucida of all mature metaphase II oocytes, however, were detected just after fertilization in the zona pellucida of zygotes and embryos. Electron microscopy using negative staining, and nanoparticle tracking analysis of embryo conditioned culture media also showed the presence of vesicles of various sizes, which were round shaped, and had a lipid bilayer. In conclusion, the results of the study provide evidence that human preimplantation embryos at all developmental stages secrete extracellular vesicles into the perivitelline space, which then traverse through the zona pellucida, and are then released into the surrounding culture medium.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between CD81 protein and HCG protein. The context primarily focuses on extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by human embryos and their characteristics.   CD81 is briefly mentioned as one of the tetraspanin EV markers, along with CD9 and CD63. The study specifically used CD9 as a marker to identify EVs in their experiments.   HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) is only mentioned in passing, likely in reference to the hormonal treatments used in the IVF process from which the embryos were obtained.  Given that these two proteins are not discussed in relation to each other, and there's no information suggesting any interaction between them, it's safe to conclude that they do not interact based on this context. However, the confidence is low because the context doesn't provide comprehensive information about all possible protein interactions, and it's focused on a specific aspect of embryo development and EV release rather than protein-protein interactions.

Therefore, the corresponding mRNA levels were compared in myocardial tissues excised from embryonic (25-60 days of gestation) and adult (2-3 years old) canine hearts. Expression level of Kv4.3, Kv1.4, KChIP2, KvLQT1, and Cav3.2 mRNAs were higher in the adult than in the embryonic hearts, while expression of Nav1.5 and minK mRNAs were higher in the embryonic than in the adult myocardium. No change in Kir2.1, HERG, Kv1.5, and Cav1.2 mRNA was observed during ontogeny. The age-dependent increase observed in the expression of Kv4.3, Kv1.4, KChIP2, and KvLQT1 is congruent with the greater repolarization reserve of the adult myocardium, associated with higher densities of Ito and IKs. The results indicate that age-dependent changes in the expression pattern of many ion channels are similar in canine and healthy human myocardium, therefore, canine cardiac muscle can be considered as a good model of studying developmental changes in the human heart.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between HERG protein and Nav1.5 protein. The passage discusses the expression patterns of various cardiac ion channels, including HERG and Nav1.5, during different developmental stages in canine hearts. However, it does not describe any direct or indirect interaction between these two specific proteins.  The text states that there was no change in HERG mRNA expression during ontogeny, while Nav1.5 mRNA expression was higher in embryonic hearts compared to adult hearts. These observations are presented independently and do not suggest any functional interaction or relationship between the two proteins.  Given that the context does not provide any information about potential interactions between HERG and Nav1.5, and only discusses their individual expression patterns, it is reasonable to conclude that there is no evidence of interaction between these two proteins based on this specific passage.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no indication of interaction in the given context, it does not definitively rule out the possibility of interaction that might be known from other sources or studies not mentioned in this particular excerpt.

In rapid proliferating cancer cells, there is a need for fast ATP and lactate production, therefore cancer cells turn off oxidative phosphorylation and turn on the so called 'Warburg effect'. This regulating the expression of genes involved in glycolysis. According to many studies, glucose transporter 1, which supplies glucose to the cell, is the most abundantly expressed transporter in cancer cells. Hexokinase 2, is one of four hexokinase isoenzymes, is also another highly expressed enzyme in cancer cells and it functions to enhance the glycolytic rate. The up-regulation of these two proteins has been established as an important factor in promoting development and metastasis in many types of cancer. Furthermore, other enzymes involved in glycolysis pathway such as phosphoglucose isomerase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, exhibit additional functions in promoting tumor growth in a non-glycolytic way. This review demonstrates the pivotal role of GLUT1, HK2, PGI and GAPDH in cancer development. In particular, we look at how the multifunctional proteins, PGI and GAPDH, affect cancer cell survival. We also present various clinical cancer cases in terms of the overexpression of selected proteins, which may be considered as a therapeutic target.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [hexokinase protein] and [GLUT1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone."

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: While the context does not explicitly state a direct interaction between hexokinase protein (specifically hexokinase 2 or HK2) and GLUT1 protein, there is evidence to suggest they interact functionally in the context of cancer cell metabolism:  1. Both proteins are mentioned as being up-regulated in cancer cells and playing important roles in promoting cancer development and metastasis.  2. GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1) is described as supplying glucose to the cell, while hexokinase 2 is mentioned as enhancing the glycolytic rate.  3. The context implies that these proteins work together in the same metabolic pathway to support the increased glucose uptake and metabolism characteristic of cancer cells (the Warburg effect).  4. Their coordinated up-regulation suggests a functional interaction in supporting cancer cell metabolism.  However, the confidence is rated as medium because:  1. The text does not explicitly state a direct physical or biochemical interaction between the two proteins.  2. The interaction is implied rather than directly observed or experimentally demonstrated in the given context.  3. While they are part of the same metabolic pathway, the exact nature of their interaction is not specified.  Given these factors, we can infer a functional interaction between hexokinase protein (HK2) and GLUT1 protein in cancer metabolism, but without more direct evidence of their interaction, we cannot state this with high confidence.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate differential expression of plasma proteins of patients with Takayasu's arteritis to screen disease-related or phase-related proteins or biomarkers. METHODS: From March, 2005 to January, 2006, Plasma of 20 patients with acute Takayasu's arteritis, 20 patients with chronic Takayasu's arteritis, and 20 healthy people as control were collected. RESULTS: Fourteen differential expression proteins were identified, including serum amyloid A, serum amyloid P, fibrinogen, complement C3c, C7, C4 binding protein, factor H related protein-1, immunoglobin, alpha-acid glycoprotein, RAG1 protein, alpha1-microglobin, apolipoprotein A-I, A-IV, transthyretin, haptoglobin. Proteins related to acute and chronic phase were serum amyloid A, fibrinogen, transthyretin, haptoglobin; Circulation levels of Serum amyloid A and Complement C4 binding protein were significantly increased in active TA patients comparing to that in inactive TA patients and in controls (SAA: 95.9 vs 49.2, P = 0.009 and 23.9 mg/L, P = 0.001, respectively; c4 binding protein: 88.5 vs 61.7, P = 0.023 and 32.6 mg/L, P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Acute phase proteins and immune proteins may possible be markers for diagnosis and activity of Takayasu's arteritis, Complement activity, complement modulation protein and antibody production may be involved in immune mechanism of Takayasu's arteritis.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the interaction between transthyretin protein and apolipoprotein A-I protein. Both proteins are mentioned in the list of differential expression proteins identified in the study, but there is no indication of any direct interaction or relationship between these two specific proteins.  The context focuses on identifying proteins that are differentially expressed in patients with Takayasu's arteritis compared to healthy controls, and on proteins that may be related to the acute and chronic phases of the disease. While both transthyretin and apolipoprotein A-I are listed among the identified proteins, the study does not provide any information about their potential interaction.  The low confidence in this answer stems from the limited information provided in the context. While there is no evidence of interaction, it's possible that these proteins could interact in ways not mentioned in this specific study. To determine if there is any interaction between these proteins, further research or more detailed studies would be necessary.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence  Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of interaction between GLUT-3 protein and GLUT-1 protein. The text primarily discusses the isolation and sequencing of ovine GLUT-3 cDNA and the tissue distribution of GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 mRNA. While both proteins are mentioned in the same context as part of the glucose transporter family, there is no information provided about their direct interaction or functional relationship.  The low confidence is due to the limited information in the given context. While the proteins are part of the same family and their mRNA distributions are studied together, this does not necessarily imply a direct interaction between the proteins themselves. More specific information about protein-protein interactions would be needed to make a definitive statement about their relationship.
367906 2A2871148 2A2652854	SQSTM1	LC3	[INST]Context: [PMID: 24401568 Hepatitis B virus X protein inhibits autophagic degradation by impairing lysosomal maturation. Deficiency in autophagy, a lysosome-dependent cell degradation pathway, has been associated with a variety of diseases especially cancer. Recently, the activation of autophagy by hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein, which is implicated in hepatitis B virus -associated hepatocellular carcinoma, has been identified in hepatic cells. However, the underlying mechanism and the relevance of HBx-activated autophagy to the carcinogenesis caused by hepatitis b virus remain elusive. Here, by transfection of hepatitis b virus genomic DNA and HBx in hepatic and hepatoma cells, we showed that HBV- or HBx-induced autophagosome formation was accompanied by unchanged mechanistic target of rapamycin activity and decreased degradation of LC3 and SQSTM1/p62, the typical autophagic cargo proteins. Further functional and morphological analysis indicated that HBx dramatically impaired lysosomal acidification leading to a drop in lysosomal degradative capacity and the accumulation of immature lysosomes possibly through interaction with V-ATPase affecting its lysosome targeting. Moreover, clinical specimen test showed increased SQSTM1 and immature lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D in human liver tissues with chronic hepatitis b virus infection and HBV-associated liver cancer.

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence suggesting that SQSTM1 (also known as p62) and LC3 proteins interact with each other in the context of autophagy. The passage states that "HBV- or HBx-induced autophagosome formation was accompanied by unchanged mechanistic target of rapamycin activity and decreased degradation of LC3 and SQSTM1/p62, the typical autophagic cargo proteins."  This statement implies that both LC3 and SQSTM1/p62 are involved in the same process (autophagy) and are affected similarly by the presence of HBV or HBx. In autophagy, LC3 is a key component of autophagosomes, while SQSTM1/p62 is an autophagy receptor that binds to cargo proteins and interacts with LC3 to facilitate their degradation.  The fact that both proteins are described as "typical autophagic cargo proteins" and their degradation is affected in the same way by HBV or HBx suggests a functional interaction between them in the autophagy pathway.  However, the confidence level is medium because the interaction between LC3 and SQSTM1/p62 is not explicitly stated or described in detail in the given context. The interaction is inferred based on their shared involvement in autophagy and their similar response to HBV or HBx.
622373 2A2865793 2A2696726	SNF5	NUP85	[INST]Context: [PMID: 23856128 Identification of the cell targets important for propolis-induced cell death in Candida albicans. Candida albicans is the most common fungal pathogen of humans, forming both commensal and opportunistic pathogenic interactions, causing a variety of skin and soft tissue infections in healthy people. In immunocompromised patients C. albicans can result in invasive, systemic infections that are associated with a high incidence of mortality. Here, we demonstrated the fungicidal activity of propolis against all three morphogenetic types of C. albicans and that propolis-induced cell death was mediated via metacaspase and Ras signaling. To identify genes that were involved in propolis tolerance, we screened ~800 C. albicans homozygous deletion mutants for decreased tolerance to propolis. Fifty-one mutant strains were identified as being hypersensitive to propolis including seventeen genes involved in cell adhesion, biofilm formation, filamentous growth, phenotypic switching and pathogenesis (HST7, GIN4, VPS34, HOG1, ISW2, SUV3, MDS3, HDA2, KAR3, YHB1, NUP85, CDC10, MNN9, ACE2, FKH2, and SNF5). We validated these results by showing that propolis inhibited the transition from yeast-like to hyphal growth. Propolis was shown to contain compounds that conferred fluorescent properties to C. albicans cells. Moreover, we have shown that a topical pharmaceutical preparation, based upon propolis, was able to control C. albicans infections in a mouse model for vulvovaginal candidiasis. Our results strongly indicate that propolis could be used as a strategy for controlling candidiasis. From MeSH: Candida albicans.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between SNF5 protein and NUP85 protein. Both proteins are listed among the 51 mutant strains identified as being hypersensitive to propolis, but this doesn't necessarily imply a direct interaction between them.   The context describes these genes as being involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, biofilm formation, filamentous growth, phenotypic switching, and pathogenesis. However, it doesn't provide any information about how these genes or their protein products might interact with each other.  Given the limited information provided, we cannot conclude that SNF5 and NUP85 proteins interact. They appear to be part of a larger group of genes involved in propolis sensitivity, but their specific relationship to each other is not described. Therefore, the answer is NO, with low confidence due to the lack of specific information about their interaction in the given context.
396554 2A2736579 2A2410434	GADD34	AIF	[INST]Context: [PMID: 19148492 Targeted therapy of human osteosarcoma with 17AAG or rapamycin: characterization of induced apoptosis and inhibition of mTOR and Akt/MAPK/Wnt pathways. Osteosarcoma is highly resistant to current chemotherapy regimens. We used 17-AAG to inhibit Hsp90 and rapamycin to inhibit mTOR, in the osteosarcoma cell lines, HOS and KHOS/NP. HOS and KHOS cells were treated for 24 and 48 h with 17-AAG or rapamycin and studied drug-induced apoptosis, cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential and levels of reduced glutathione, dephosphorylation of signal transduction proteins in the Akt/MAP kinase pathway and mTOR signaling. 17-AAG was a potent inducer of apoptosis, involving effective depletion of glutathione and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, strong activation of caspase-8 and -9 and release of AIF from mitochondria to the cytosol. Furthermore, 17-AAG down-regulated pAkt, p44Erk, p-mTOR, p70S6, TSC1/2 and pGSK-3beta. Treatment with 17-AAG also caused down-regulation of cyclin D1, GADD45a, GADD34 and pCdc2 and upregulation of cyclin B1 and mitotic block. A decrease in Hsp90 and increase in Hsp70 and Hsp70 C-terminal fragments were also observed. Rapamycin was a less potent inducer of apoptosis, involving a small decrease in glutathione and mitochondrial membrane potential with no activation of caspases or release of AIF. Rapamycin strongly inhibited cell growth with an increase in G1 and a decrease in S-phase of the cell cycle concomitant with down-regulation of cyclin D1. Rapamycin also down-regulated the activity of p70S6, pAkt and p-mTOR, but had no effect on pGSK-3beta, p44Erk, pCdc2, TSC1/2 or Hsp70 or Hsp90. We conclude that Hsp90 inhibition merits further study in the therapy of osteosarcoma.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GADD34 protein] and [AIF protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any direct interaction between GADD34 protein and AIF protein. The passage mentions both proteins, but in separate contexts:  1. GADD34 is mentioned as being down-regulated by treatment with 17-AAG.  2. AIF (Apoptosis-Inducing Factor) is mentioned as being released from mitochondria to the cytosol as part of the apoptotic process induced by 17-AAG.  While both proteins are affected by the 17-AAG treatment, there is no information provided about any direct interaction between GADD34 and AIF. They appear to be involved in different aspects of the cellular response to 17-AAG treatment.  The confidence is low because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, it's possible that these proteins could interact in ways not mentioned in this specific study. Without more comprehensive information about these proteins and their potential interactions, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of an interaction.
648496 2A2600684 2A2535670	IkappaBalpha	FcgammaRIIb	[INST]Context: [PMID: 14985941 Intravenous immunoglobulin inhibits NF-kappaB activation and affects Fcgamma receptor expression in monocytes/macrophages. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is well established as a standard therapy for Kawasaki disease that reduces the risk of developing coronary artery aneurysms. Activation of monocytes/macrophages and tumor necrosis factor-alpha activity are responsible for severe vascular injury in acute kawasaki disease. We examined whether or not intravenous immunoglobulin inhibits TNF-alpha-induced activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB, a factor that is essential for the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, in human monocytic U-937 cells. The inhibitory effect of intravenous immunoglobulin on NF-kappaB activation induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha was evaluated by Western blotting and flow cytometry. In addition, we examined the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin on the expression of FcgammaIII (CD16) and FcgammaRIIb (CD32b) in U-937 cells and peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes/macrophages by flow cytometry. Western blotting demonstrated that intravenous immunoglobulin inhibits NF-kappaB activation in U-937 cells, and flow cytometry that intravenous immunoglobulin inhibits NF-kappaB activation in U-937 cells in a dose-related manner. Western blotting of cytoplasmic extracts of U-937 cells revealed that intravenous immunoglobulin inhibited degradation of the IkappaBalpha protein. Moreover, flow cytometry demonstrated that intravenous immunoglobulin decreased the expression of FcgammaRIII in U-937 cells and peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes/macrophages. However, Western blotting revealed that intravenous immunoglobulin did not affect the quantity of FcgammaRIII protein, and PCR that intravenous immunoglobulin did not affect the quantity of FcgammaRIII mRNA in the cells. These findings suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin inhibits TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in monocytes/macrophages, and blocks FcgammaRIII on the membranes of monocytes/macrophages.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [IkappaBalpha protein] and [FcgammaRIIb protein] interact with each other?

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between the IkappaBalpha protein and the FcgammaRIIb protein. The passage discusses these proteins separately in different contexts:  1. IkappaBalpha protein: The text mentions that intravenous immunoglobulin inhibited the degradation of IkappaBalpha protein, which is related to the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation.  2. FcgammaRIIb (CD32b): The passage mentions that the researchers examined the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin on the expression of FcgammaRIIb, but does not provide specific results for this receptor.  The context does not provide any information suggesting a direct interaction or relationship between these two proteins. However, since the study focuses on the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin on various cellular processes and proteins, it's possible that there could be indirect connections not explicitly stated in the given text.

87265 2A2415415 2A2876688	PRMT1	SUMO-1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 28695742 Human Regulatory Protein Ki-1/57 Is a Target of SUMOylation and Affects PML Nuclear Body Formation. Ki-1/57 is a nuclear and cytoplasmic regulatory protein first identified in malignant cells from Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is involved in gene expression regulation on both transcriptional and mRNA metabolism levels. Ki-1/57 belongs to the family of intrinsically unstructured proteins and undergoes phosphorylation by PKC and methylation by PRMT1. Previous characterization of its protein interaction profile by yeast two-hybrid screening showed that Ki-1/57 interacts with proteins of the SUMOylation machinery, the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme UBC9 and the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS3, which suggested that Ki-1/57 could be involved with this process. Here we identified seven potential SUMO target sites (lysine residues) on Ki-1/57 sequence and observed that Ki-1/57 is modified by SUMO proteins in vitro and in vivo. We showed that SUMOylation of Ki-1/57 occurred on lysines 213, 276, and 336. More interestingly, after treating cells with arsenic trioxide (As2O3), the number of pml-nuclear bodies is no longer reduced when the non-SUMOylated triple mutant Ki-1/57 is expressed, suggesting that the SUMOylation of Ki-1/57 has a role in the control of As2O3-induced PML-NB formation. A proteome-wide analysis of Ki-1/57 partners in the presence of either SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 suggests that the involvement of Ki-1/57 with the regulation of gene expression is independent of the presence of either SUMO-1 or SUMO-2; However, the presence of SUMO-1 strongly influences the interaction of Ki-1/57 with proteins associated with cellular metabolism, maintenance, and cell cycle.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of an interaction between PRMT1 protein and SUMO-1 protein. The passage mentions that Ki-1/57 undergoes methylation by PRMT1 and is also modified by SUMO proteins, but it does not indicate any direct interaction or relationship between PRMT1 and SUMO-1 specifically.  The context focuses on the SUMOylation of Ki-1/57 and its effects, particularly mentioning SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 in relation to Ki-1/57's protein interactions. PRMT1 is only briefly mentioned as being responsible for methylation of Ki-1/57, but there's no information suggesting it interacts with SUMO-1 or any other SUMO protein.  Given the lack of specific information about any interaction between PRMT1 and SUMO-1, and the fact that they are mentioned in different contexts within the passage, I cannot conclude that they interact. However, due to the limited scope of the provided information, I assign a low confidence to this assessment, as there could potentially be interactions not mentioned in this specific context.

Publication of this consensus statement is a joint initiative of the Spanish Society of Pathology and the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM), intended to revise and update the diagnostic and treatment recommendations published 2 years ago on biomarker use and the management of patients with colorectal carcinoma, thereby providing an opportunity to improve healthcare efficiency and resource use in these patients. This expert group recommends testing for KRAS and NRAS status in all patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma being considered for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy, as this type of treatment should only be used in patients not harbouring mutations in these genes. In contrast, testing for BRAF, EGFR, PI3K and PTEN mutation status is not necessary for therapeutic decision making, so does not need to be done routinely.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [KRAS protein] and [PTEN protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct indication of an interaction between KRAS protein and PTEN protein. The text mentions both KRAS and PTEN, but they are discussed in separate contexts:  1. KRAS (along with NRAS) is recommended for testing in all patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma being considered for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy.  2. PTEN is mentioned as one of the genes (along with BRAF, EGFR, and PI3K) that does not need to be routinely tested for therapeutic decision making.  The text does not describe any direct interaction, relationship, or combined effect between KRAS and PTEN proteins. They are simply listed as different biomarkers that are considered in the context of colorectal carcinoma testing and treatment.  The confidence level is medium because while the text doesn't suggest an interaction, it also doesn't explicitly state that these proteins do not interact. There could potentially be interactions between these proteins that are not mentioned in this specific context.
365620 2A2592211 2A2652496	Hsc70	MAPK14	[INST]Context: [PMID: 35282608 Phosphorylation of the Hepatitis B Virus Large Envelope Protein. We here establish the phosphorylation sites in the human hepatitis B virus large envelope protein (L). L is involved in several functionally important interactions in the viral life cycle, including with the hepatitis b virus cellular receptor, hepatitis b virus capsid, Hsc70 chaperone, and cellular membranes during fusion. We have recently shown that cell-free synthesis of the homologous L protein of duck hepatitis b virus in wheat germ extract results in very similar phosphorylation events to those previously observed in animal cells. Here, we used mass spectrometry and NMR to establish the phosphorylation patterns of human hepatitis b virus L protein produced by both in vitro cell-free synthesis and in E. coli with the co-expression of the human MAPK14 kinase. While in the avian virus the phosphorylation of L has been shown to be dispensable for infectivity, the identified locations in the human virus protein, both in the PreS1 and PreS2 domains, raise the intriguing possibility that they might play a functional role, since they are found at strategic sites predicted to be involved in L interactions. This would warrant the further investigation of a possible function in virion formation or cell entry.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Hsc70 protein] and [MAPK14 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Explanation: The context does not provide any information about a direct interaction between the Hsc70 protein and the MAPK14 protein. These two proteins are mentioned in separate contexts within the passage:  1. Hsc70 chaperone is mentioned as one of the proteins that the hepatitis B virus large envelope protein (L) interacts with during the viral life cycle.  2. MAPK14 kinase is mentioned as a human kinase that was co-expressed with the L protein in E. coli to study phosphorylation patterns.  While both proteins are related to the study of the hepatitis B virus L protein, there is no indication that they interact with each other directly. The passage focuses on the phosphorylation of the L protein and its interactions with various cellular components, but it does not suggest any relationship between Hsc70 and MAPK14.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, it's possible that these proteins could interact in other biological processes not mentioned in this specific passage.
618581 2A2613339 2A2714841	ERG	CD31	[INST]Context: [PMID: 27515856 Diagnostic utility of FOSB immunohistochemistry in pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma and its histological mimics. BACKGROUND: Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is an unusual vascular tumor of intermediate malignancy that rarely metastasizes and tends to arise in the lower limbs of young adults and children. Histologically, pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma shows fascicular proliferation of eosinophilic spindle cells and/or epithelioid cells showing 'pseudomyogenic' morphology. Immunohistochemically, pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is usually positive for vimentin, cytokeratin, CD31 and ERG. METHOD: We examined FOSB immunohistochemistry in 27 cases consisting of 4 pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma and its histologic mimics including 6 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas, 8 angiosarcomas, 4 Kaposi sarcomas and 5 epithelioid sarcomas . In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry of CAMTA1 which has recently been established as a useful marker of epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas. We elucidated the diagnostic utility of FOSB immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma and its histological mimics and also examined the usefulness of FOSB and CAMTA1 immunohistochemistry combination in the differential diagnosis of the tumors. RESULTS: immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse and strong FOSB expression in all pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma cases, while the other tumor types demonstrated limited, weak or no FOSB expression. All epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas cases exhibited diffuse and moderate to strong expression of CAMTA1. All tumor types except for epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas showed limited, weak or no CAMTA1 reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse and strong FOSB expression was specific for pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in the current series and FOSB immunohistochemistry is an effective tool for differentiating between pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma and its histological mimics. Moreover, the combination of FOSB and CAMTA1 immunohistochemistry is useful for distinguishing pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma from epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [ERG protein] and [CD31 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence   Explanation: The context provided does not explicitly mention any interaction between ERG protein and CD31 protein. These proteins are only mentioned together in a list of markers that are usually positive in pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma: "Immunohistochemically, pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma is usually positive for vimentin, cytokeratin, CD31 and ERG." This statement simply indicates that both proteins are typically expressed in this type of tumor, but it does not suggest any direct interaction between them.  The focus of the study is on the diagnostic utility of FOSB and CAMTA1 immunohistochemistry in differentiating pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma from its histological mimics. The interaction between ERG and CD31 is not discussed or investigated in this context.  Given the limited information provided about ERG and CD31, and the lack of any statement suggesting their interaction, we cannot conclude that these proteins interact with each other based on this context. However, the confidence is low because the absence of evidence for interaction in this specific context does not rule out the possibility that these proteins might interact in other biological processes or contexts not mentioned in this study.
365518 2A2592211 2A2434596	HSPA8	ATP5B	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34580608 Identification of Potential Core Genes in Parkinson's Disease Using Bioinformatics Analysis. Purpose: This study aimed to explore new core genes related to the occurrence of Parkinson's disease and core genes that can lead to the progression of parkinson's disease. Methods: The expression profile data of GSE42966, which contained six substantia nigra tissues isolated from normal individuals and nine substantia nigra tissues isolated from patients with parkinson's disease, were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. Ten hub genes were identified through the protein-protein interaction network, namely, GNG3, MAPK1, FPR1, ATP5B, GNG2, PRKACA, HRAS, HSPA8, PSAP, and GABBR2. The expression of HRAS was different in patients with parkinson's disease with Braak stages 3 and 4. Conclusion: These 10 hub genes and the metabolic pathways they are enriched in may be involved in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease. HRAS may have potential value in predicting the progression of parkinson's disease.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [HSPA8 protein] and [ATP5B protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone."

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation:  Based on the given context, HSPA8 and ATP5B are both listed among the ten hub genes identified through the protein-protein interaction network analysis for Parkinson's disease. While the context does not explicitly state a direct interaction between HSPA8 and ATP5B, their inclusion in the same hub gene set within a protein-protein interaction network suggests a potential functional relationship or interaction between these proteins.  Protein-protein interaction networks typically represent proteins that are likely to be involved in similar biological processes or pathways. The fact that both HSPA8 and ATP5B were identified as hub genes in this network indicates that they may have important roles in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and could potentially interact with each other, either directly or indirectly, within the cellular mechanisms related to the disease.  However, since the context does not provide specific details about the nature of their interaction or experimental evidence confirming a direct interaction between HSPA8 and ATP5B, we cannot be entirely certain of their interaction. This is why I've assigned a medium confidence level to this assessment.  To confirm a direct interaction between these proteins, further experimental evidence or more detailed information about their specific roles in the protein-protein interaction network would be needed.

The goal of this study was to assess the behavior of selected cytokines and growth factors within the peritoneal fluid in pathologies associated with ascites and to assess the relationship between the levels of these substances and select prognostic factors of ovarian cancer. METHODS: A total of 74 patients were enrolled in the study, including 36 patients with ovarian cancer and 38 patients with benign gynecological conditions. Peritoneal fluid collected during surgical procedures was used to assess the levels of interleukin -6, IL-8, stem cell factor, dickkopf-1, growth differentiation factor-15, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), osteoprotegerin, osteopontin, osteonectin, and human epididymis protein 4. The median levels of these factors were compared between the two groups, and the levels of selected factors were assessed in the ovarian cancer group with regard to the clinical stage of cancer, tumor differentiation, presence of peritoneal spread and positive peritoneal fluid cytology results. RESULTS: Differences were observed between the patients with ovarian cancer and the patients with benign gynecological conditions associated with ascites with regard to the levels of IL-6, IL-8, growth differentiation factor-15, stem cell factor, osteopontin, osteonectin, and osteoprotegerin. There were no differences in dickkopf-1, TRAIL, and human epididymis protein 4 levels between the two study groups. Cancer stage affected only the mean stem cell factor and osteoprotegerin levels, with lower stem cell factor values and higher osteoprotegerin values in advanced cancers compared to less-advanced cancers. Tumor differentiation was associated with significantly lower stem cell factor values in the group of poorly differentiated tumors. A significant reduction in stem cell factor values and a significant increase in osteoprotegerin and IL-6 values were also observed within cancer cell-positive peritoneal fluid. Peritoneal spread was associated with higher levels of TRAIL, osteonectin, and IL-6 in ovarian cancer patients. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the conducted studies, it appears that of the studied factors, growth differentiation factor-15, stem cell factor, and osteoprotegerin deserve special attention in the context of future research on the tumor microenvironment. With regard to diagnostics, attention should be given primarily to growth differentiation factor-15, IL-6, and osteonectin.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [osteopontin protein] and [interleukin -6 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of interaction between osteopontin protein and interleukin-6 protein. The study does report differences in the levels of both osteopontin and IL-6 between patients with ovarian cancer and those with benign gynecological conditions. However, this does not necessarily imply an interaction between these two proteins.  The study examines various cytokines, proteins, and growth factors individually in relation to ovarian cancer and benign conditions. While both osteopontin and IL-6 are mentioned as having different levels between the two patient groups, there is no information provided about any direct interaction or relationship between these two specific proteins.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, the study does not explicitly state that there is no interaction between these proteins. It's possible that such an interaction exists but was not the focus of this particular study or was not observed in this context.
197459 2A2430988 2A2544793	activating transcription factor 3	Fascin	[INST]Context: [PMID: 24569468 A novel staging model to classify oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients in China. BACKGROUND: Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant subtype of oesophageal carcinoma in China, with the overall 5-year survival rate of <10%. We aim to combine clinical variables and biomarkers to develop and validate a relative simple and reliable model, named the FENSAM, for ESCC prognosis. METHODS: To build the FENSAM, we analysed 22 potential prognostic factors from 461 patients, including 9 biomarkers (Ezrin, Fascin, desmocollin 2 (DSC2), pFascin, activating transcription factor 3, connective-tissue growth factor, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin receptor, and cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61 (CYR61)) and other 13 clinical variables. We selected significant factors associated with survival of ESCC patients, and used them to build our FENSAM model. We then obtained the hazard risk score of the model to classify ESCC patients. In addition, we validated the model in an independent cohort of 290 patients from the same hospital. RESULTS: We found six markers significantly associated with survival of ESCC patients (Ezrin, Fascin, activating transcription factor 3, surgery extent, N-stage, and M-stage). They were combined to create a novel four-stage FENSAM model for patients' classification. The validation result demonstrated the potential of the FENSAM model to improve classification accuracy for ESCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: FENSAM provides an alternative classifier for ESCC patients with a high classification precision using a simple model.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [activating transcription factor 3 protein] and [Fascin protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence  Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between activating transcription factor 3 protein and Fascin protein. The text lists these as two separate biomarkers among several others that were analyzed as potential prognostic factors for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Both proteins are mentioned as being significantly associated with survival of ESCC patients, but there is no information given about any direct interaction or relationship between them.  The study appears to focus on using these proteins, along with other clinical variables, as independent prognostic factors to create a classification model for ESCC patients. Without additional information about how these proteins might interact or influence each other's activity in the context of ESCC, we cannot conclude that they interact based solely on this text.  The confidence is low because while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, the possibility of an interaction cannot be completely ruled out without more comprehensive information about these proteins and their roles in ESCC.
675651 2A2855033 2A2572245	Nav1.5	Glut1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34359733 Neonatal Nav1.5 Protein Expression in Human Colorectal Cancer: Immunohistochemical Characterization and Clinical Evaluation. Voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs) are expressed widely in human carcinomas and play a significant role in promoting cellular invasiveness and metastasis. However, human tissue-based studies and clinical characterization are lacking. In several carcinomas, including colorectal cancer, the predominant VGSC is the neonatal splice variant of Nav1.5 (nNav1.5). The present study was designed to determine the expression patterns and clinical relevance of nNav1.5 protein in human colorectal cancer tissues from patients with available clinicopathological history. The analysis showed that, compared with normal mucosa, nNav1.5 expression occurred in colorectal cancer samples (i) at levels that were significantly higher and (ii) with a pattern that was more delineated (i.e., apical/basal or mixed). A surprisingly high level of nNav1.5 protein expression also occurred in adenomas, but this was mainly intracellular and diffuse. NNav1.5 showed a statistically significant association with TNM stage, highest expression being associated with TNM IV and metastatic status. Interestingly, nNav1.5 expression co-occurred with other biomarkers associated with metastasis, including hERG1, KCa3.1, VEGF-A, Glut1, and EGFR. We conclude (i) that nNav1.5 could represent a novel clinical biomarker ('companion diagnostic') useful to better stratify colorectal cancer patients and (ii) that since nNav1.5 expression is functional, it could form the basis of anti-metastatic therapies including in combination with standard treatments.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Nav1.5 protein] and [Glut1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a direct interaction between Nav1.5 protein and Glut1 protein. The text mentions that nNav1.5 expression co-occurred with other biomarkers associated with metastasis, including Glut1, but this does not necessarily imply a direct interaction between the two proteins.  The co-occurrence of these proteins in the context of metastasis suggests they may be part of related cellular processes or signaling pathways involved in cancer progression. However, without further information about their functional relationship or any direct physical or biochemical interaction, we cannot conclude that they interact with each other in the way described in the interacting example.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of direct interaction, the co-occurrence in the context of metastasis leaves open the possibility of some indirect or functional relationship that is not explicitly stated in the given text.
306031 2A2459929 2A2509801	CDKN1A	CDC2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 9806590 Intercellular communication is involved in the bystander regulation of gene expression in human cells exposed to very low fluences of alpha particles. We demonstrate by western analysis that the expression levels of TP53 (formerly known as p53), CDKN1A (formerly known as p21Waf1), CDC2 (formerly known as p34cdc2), CCNB1 (cyclin B1) and RAD51 are significantly modulated in confluent, density-inhibited human diploid cell populations exposed to doses where only a small fraction of the nuclei are actually traversed by an alpha-particle track. The extent of modulation of TP53 and CDKN1A is significantly reduced in the presence of the gap junction inhibitor lindane and in irradiated low-density cell populations. In situ immunofluorescence studies show that at doses where about 2% of the nuclei would be traversed by an alpha particle, induction of CDKN1A occurs in more cells than predicted. Therefore, our studies at the gene expression level indicate that similar signaling pathways are induced in bystander cells that are not traversed by an alpha particle as in traversed cells, and that biological effects in cell populations are not restricted to the response of individual cells to the DNA damage they receive.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CDKN1A protein] and [CDC2 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence.   Explanation: The context does not provide direct evidence of interaction between CDKN1A protein and CDC2 protein. While both proteins are mentioned as being modulated in response to alpha particle exposure, there is no explicit statement or implication of a direct interaction between these two specific proteins.  The passage states that "the expression levels of TP53 (formerly known as p53), CDKN1A (formerly known as p21Waf1), CDC2 (formerly known as p34cdc2), CCNB1 (cyclin B1) and RAD51 are significantly modulated" in cells exposed to alpha particles. This indicates that these proteins are all affected by the same stimulus, but it does not necessarily mean they interact with each other directly.  The text focuses more on the bystander effect and the role of intercellular communication in modulating gene expression, rather than on specific protein-protein interactions. Without additional information about the relationship between CDKN1A and CDC2, we cannot conclude that they interact based solely on this context.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction provided, it's also not explicitly stated that they don't interact, and it's possible that these proteins could have known interactions that are simply not mentioned in this specific context.
383413 2A2525717 2A2601220	EphB6	IL6	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34943232 Free Fatty Acid Species Differentially Modulate the Inflammatory Gene Response in Primary Human Skeletal Myoblasts. Age-related loss of skeletal muscle is associated with obesity and inflammation. However, the relevant fat components that mediate muscular inflammation are not known. Previously, we hypothesized that free fatty acids may directly induce inflammatory gene expression in skeletal muscle cells of obese rats. Here, we examined this hypothesis in primary human skeletal myoblasts using multiplex expression analysis of 39 inflammatory proteins in response to different FFA species. Multiplex mRNA quantification confirmed that the IL6, IL1RA, IL4, LIF, CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL12 and CCL2 genes were differentially regulated by saturated and unsaturated C16 or C18 free fatty acids. Fluorescence staining revealed that only saturated C16 and C18 strongly interfere with myoblast replication independent of desmin expression, mitochondrial abundance and oxidative activity. Furthermore, we addressed the possible implications of 71 human receptor tyrosine kinases in FFA-mediated effects. Phosphorylated EphB6 and TNK2 were associated with impaired myoblast replication by saturated C16 and C18 free fatty acids. Our data suggest that abundant FFA species in human skeletal muscle tissue may play a decisive role in the progression of sarcopenic obesity by affecting inflammatory signals or myoblast replication.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [EphB6 protein] and [IL6 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between EphB6 protein and IL6 protein. The text mentions both proteins, but in different contexts:  1. IL6 is listed among the genes that were differentially regulated by saturated and unsaturated C16 or C18 free fatty acids.  2. Phosphorylated EphB6 is associated with impaired myoblast replication by saturated C16 and C18 free fatty acids.  While both proteins are mentioned in relation to the effects of free fatty acids, there is no explicit statement or implication of interaction between EphB6 and IL6. They appear to be involved in separate processes or pathways affected by free fatty acids.  However, the confidence is low because the context provided is limited, and there could potentially be indirect interactions or connections between these proteins that are not mentioned in this specific excerpt.

To elucidate the key molecules, functions, and pathways that bridge mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, we investigated open gene expression data sets. One module was significantly negatively associated with mild cognitive impairment samples, in which gene ontology function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis showed that these genes were related to cytosolic ribosome, ribosomal structure, oxidative phosphorylation, alzheimer's disease, and metabolic pathway. The other two modules correlated significantly with alzheimer's disease samples, in which functional and pathway enrichment analysis revealed strong relationships of these genes with cytoplasmic ribosome, protein binding, alzheimer's disease, cancer, and apoptosis. In addition, we regarded the core genes in the module network closely related to mild cognitive impairment and alzheimer's disease as bridge genes and submitted them to protein interaction network analysis to screen for major pathogenic genes according to the connectivity information. Among them, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein D2 polypeptide (SNRPD2), ribosomal protein S3a, S100 calcium binding protein A8 (S100A8), small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide G, U6 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm3 (LSM3), ribosomal protein S27a, and ATP synthase F1 subunit gamma (ATP5C1) were not only major pathogenic genes of mild cognitive impairment, but also bridge genes. In addition, SNRPD2, ribosomal protein s3a, S100A8, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide g, LSM3, thioredoxin, proteasome 20S subunit alpha 4 (PSMA4), annexin A1, DnaJ heat shock protein family member A1 (DNAJA1), and prefoldin subunit 5 were not only major pathogenic genes of alzheimer's disease, but also bridge genes. Next, we screened for differentially expressed microRNAs to predict the micrornas and transcription factors related the mild cognitive impairment and alzheimer's disease modules, respectively. Thirty-four bridge regulators were analyzed, among which hsa-miR-519d-3p was recognized as the bridge regulator between mild cognitive impairment and alzheimer's disease. Our study contributed to a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of mild cognitive impairment and alzheimer's disease, and might lead to the development of a new strategy for clinical diagnosis and treatment.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [U6 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm3 protein] and [ATP synthase F1 subunit gamma protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a direct interaction between U6 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm3 (LSM3) and ATP synthase F1 subunit gamma (ATP5C1). While both proteins are listed as "major pathogenic genes of mild cognitive impairment" and "bridge genes," this does not necessarily imply a direct interaction between them.  The context mentions these proteins as part of a larger set of genes identified through gene expression data analysis and protein interaction network analysis. However, it does not provide specific information about how these individual proteins interact with each other.  Without more detailed information about the protein interaction network or experimental evidence of a direct interaction between LSM3 and ATP5C1, we cannot conclude that these two proteins interact. They appear to be part of the same biological context (mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease), but this alone is not sufficient to establish a direct interaction.  The confidence level is medium because while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of an interaction that might be known from other sources not mentioned in this specific text.

We have identified and characterised a cluster of six TRIM-B30.2 genes flanking the chicken BF/BL region of the B complex. In humans, a cluster of seven TRIM-B30.2 genes has been characterised within the MHC on Chromosome 6p21.33. Among the six chicken TRIM-B30.2 genes two are orthologous to those of the human MHC, and two (TRIM41 and TRIM7) are orthologous to human genes located on Chromosome 5. In humans, these last two genes are adjacent to GNB2L1, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein gene, the ortholog of the chicken c12.3 gene situated in the vicinity of the TRIM-B30.2 genes. This suggests that breakpoints specific to mammals have occurred and led to the remodelling of their MHC structure. In terms of structure, like their mammalian counterparts, each chicken gene consists of five coding exons; Phylogenetic analysis led us to assume that this extended BF/BL region may be similar to the human extended class I region, because it contains a cluster of BG genes sharing an Ig-V like domain with the BTN genes (Henry et al. 1997a) and six TRIM-B30.2 genes containing the B30.2-like domain, shared with the TRIM-B30.2 members and the BTN genes.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence  Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of an interaction between GNB2L1 protein and TRIM41 protein. The information given only states that in humans, TRIM41 and TRIM7 genes are adjacent to GNB2L1, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein gene. This proximity in genomic location does not necessarily imply a functional interaction between the proteins.  The context primarily discusses the structural organization of genes in the chicken MHC B locus and compares it to the human MHC region. While it mentions that TRIM41 and GNB2L1 are located near each other in humans, it does not provide any information about direct protein-protein interactions or functional relationships between their protein products.  Given the lack of specific information about protein interactions and the focus on genomic organization rather than protein function, I cannot confidently state that these proteins interact. However, the low confidence is due to the limited scope of the provided information, which does not rule out the possibility of an interaction that may be described in other sources not included in this context.
44587 2A2918856 2A2398800	CTS	EIF4EBP1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 29940807 TRIM37 deficiency induces autophagy through deregulating the MTORC1-TFEB axis. TRIM37 gene mutations cause mulibrey nanism, a severe growth disorder with prenatal onset. Although TRIM37 depletion normally induces apoptosis, patients with TRIM37 mutations have a high risk of developing tumors, suggesting that there may be an alternative pro-survival mechanism for TRIM37-deficient tumor cells. We find that TRIM37 interacts with MTOR and RRAGB proteins, enhances the MTOR-RRAGB interaction and promotes lysosomal localization of MTOR, thereby activating amino acid-stimulated MTORC1 signaling. In response to loss of TRIM37 functions, phosphorylation of TFEB is significantly reduced, resulting in its translocation into the nucleus enabling its transcriptional activation of genes involved in lysosome biogenesis and macroautophagy/autophagy. The enhanced autophagy depends on the inhibition of MTORC1 signaling and may serve as an alternative mechanism to survive the loss of TRIM37 functions. Our study unveils a positive role of TRIM37 in regulating the MTORC1-TFEB axis and provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of mulibrey nanism, as well as potential therapeutic treatment.

Background: Breast cancer is the most common tumor in women, and lipid metabolism involvement has been demonstrated in its tumorigenesis and development. However, the role of lipid metabolism-associated genes in the immune microenvironment and prognosis of breast cancer remains unclear. Methods: A total of 1076 patients with breast cancer were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and randomly assigned to the training cohort (n = 760) or validation cohort (n = 316). Consensus clustering was performed to categorize the patients with breast cancer into subtypes. Results: Consensus clustering classified the patients with breast cancer into two subgroups with significantly different overall survival rates and immune microenvironments. The prognostic risk model, based on four lipid metabolism-associated genes (MED10, PLA2G2D, CYP4F11, and GPS2), successfully stratified the patients into high- and low-risk groups in both the training and validation sets. Subgroup analysis suggested that the risk model was an independent predictor of prognosis in breast cancer. Conclusion: This study demonstrated, for the first time, that LMAG expression plays a crucial role in breast cancer. The LMAG-based risk model successfully predicted the prognosis and indicated the immune microenvironment of patients with breast cancer. Our study may provide inspiration for further research on breast cancer pathomechanisms.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GPS2 protein] and [MED10 protein] interact with each other?

They are mentioned together as components of this model, but there is no information about their direct interaction or functional relationship.  The low confidence is due to the limited information provided about these specific proteins in the given context.

More specific research focused on these two proteins would be needed to determine if they interact in any way.
496398 2A2658178 2A2441644	MEK	p130cas	[INST]Context: [PMID: 29132432 AC-93253 iodide, a novel Src inhibitor, suppresses non-small cell lung cancer progression by modulating multiple Src-related signaling pathways. BACKGROUND: The tyrosine kinase Src is involved in the progression of many cancers. Moreover, inhibiting Src activity has been shown to obstruct several signaling pathways regulated by the EGFR. Thus, Src is a valuable target molecule in drug development. The purpose of this study was to identify compounds that directly or indirectly modulate Src to suppress lung cancer cell growth and motility and to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of these compounds. METHODS: Human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (PC9, PC9/gef, A549, and H1975) with different EGFR statuses were tested by cytotoxicity and proliferation assays after AC-93253 iodide treatment. Src and Src-related protein expression in AC-93253 iodide-treated PC9, PC9/gef, and A549 cells were assessed by western blotting. The effects of AC-93253 iodide on cancer cell colony formation, invasion, and migration were assessed in PC9 and PC9/gef cells. The synergistic effects of gefitinib and AC-93253 iodide were evaluated by combination index -isobologram analysis in gefitinib-resistant cell lines. The efficacy of AC-93253 iodide in vivo was determined using nude mice treated with either the compound or the vehicle. RESULTS: Among the compounds, AC-93253 iodide exhibited the most potent dose-independent inhibitory effects on the activity of Src as well as on that of the Src-related proteins EGFR, STAT3, and FAK. Furthermore, AC-93253 iodide significantly suppressed cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. AC-93253 iodide sensitized tumor cells to gefitinib treatment regardless of whether the cells were gefitinib-sensitive (PC9) or resistant (H1975 and PC9/gef), indicating that it may exert synergistic effects when used in combination with established therapeutic agents. Our findings also suggested that the inhibitory effects of AC-93253 iodide on lung cancer progression may be attributable to its ability to modulate multiple proteins, including Src, PI3K, JNK, Paxillin, p130cas, MEK, ERK, and EGFR. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that AC-93253 iodide inhibits non-small cell lung cancer cell growth and motility by regulating multiple Src-related pathways. Our findings may facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies and anti-tumor drugs that may be useful for treating lung cancer in the future.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [MEK protein] and [p130cas protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a direct interaction between MEK protein and p130cas protein. The passage lists these proteins among others that are modulated by AC-93253 iodide, but it does not describe any specific interaction between them.   The text states: "Our findings also suggested that the inhibitory effects of AC-93253 iodide on lung cancer progression may be attributable to its ability to modulate multiple proteins, including Src, PI3K, JNK, Paxillin, p130cas, MEK, ERK, and EGFR."  Both MEK and p130cas are mentioned in this list, indicating that they are both affected by AC-93253 iodide. However, this does not necessarily mean they interact with each other. They appear to be part of the broader network of proteins affected by the compound, but no specific interaction between these two proteins is described.  The confidence is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, it's possible that these proteins could interact in ways not mentioned in this specific study. More comprehensive research would be needed to definitively rule out any interaction between MEK and p130cas.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence   Explanation:  Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between SMARCB1 protein and IDH1 protein. The passage mentions these proteins separately in different contexts:  1. SMARCB1 mutations are associated with dMMR (deficient mismatch repair) tumors. 2. IDH1 mutations are associated with Crohn's disease.  These proteins are mentioned in relation to different aspects of small bowel adenocarcinoma, but there is no information suggesting that they interact with each other or have any combined effects. The context does not provide any details about a functional or physical interaction between these two proteins.  However, I've assigned a low confidence to this answer because the provided information is limited, and it's possible that there could be interactions between these proteins that are not mentioned in this specific context. To make a more definitive statement, we would need more comprehensive information about the roles and relationships of these proteins in small bowel adenocarcinoma or related biological processes.

Human malignant melanoma has poor prognosis because of resistance to apoptosis and therapy. We describe identification of the expression profile of 1,037 mitochondria-focused genes and 84 survival-apoptosis genes in 21 malignant melanoma cell lines and 3 normal melanocyte controls using recently developed hMitChip3 cDNA microarrays. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of 1,037 informative genes, and 84 survival-apoptosis genes, classified these malignant melanoma cell lines into type A (n = 12) and type B (n = 9). Antiapoptotic (BCL2, BCL2A1, PPARD, and RAF1), antioxidant (MT3, PRDX5, PRDX3, GPX4, GLRX2, and GSR), and proapoptotic (BAD, BNIP1, APAF1, BNIP3L, CASP7, CYCS, CASP1, and VDAC1) genes expressed at higher levels in type A than in type B, whereas the different set of antiapoptotic (PSEN1, PPP2CA, API5, PPP2R1B, PPP2R1A, and FIS1), antioxidant (HSPD1, GSS, SOD1, ATOX1, and CAT), and proapoptotic (ENDOG, BAK1, CASP2, CASP4, PDCD5, HTRA2, SEPT4, TNFSF10, and PRODH) genes expressed at lower levels in type A than in type B.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between BNIP3L protein and PDCD5 protein. The passage mentions both proteins, but they are listed as part of different groups of genes expressed at different levels in two types of malignant melanoma cell lines.  BNIP3L is mentioned as a proapoptotic gene that is expressed at higher levels in type A melanoma cells, while PDCD5 is listed as a proapoptotic gene expressed at lower levels in type A melanoma cells (and thus at higher levels in type B cells).  The text does not describe any direct interaction, co-regulation, or functional relationship between these two proteins. They are simply listed as part of the gene expression profiles that distinguish the two types of melanoma cell lines.  Given the limited information provided and the lack of any statement about their interaction, we cannot conclude that BNIP3L and PDCD5 proteins interact. However, since both are involved in apoptosis pathways, there is a possibility of some indirect interaction or relationship that is not mentioned in this specific context, which is why I've assigned a low confidence to this assessment.

Here we investigated whether one of homeobox-containing genes, Msx1, might be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle using Msx1 overexpressing human ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR3. Overexpression of Msx1 in OVCAR3 cells inhibited cell proliferation by markedly increasing the length of the G1 phase of the cell cycle over control cells. Consistent with this result, dramatic suppression of cyclins D1, D3, E, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, c-Jun, and Rb was observed. Elevated expression of genes involved in the growth arrest and apoptosis (GADD153 and apoptotic cystein protease MCH4) and suppression of proliferation associated protein gene in Msx1-overexpressing cells by cDNA expression array analysis provide further evidence for a potential repressor function of Msx1 in cell cycle progression.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [cyclin-dependent kinase 4 protein] and [proliferation associated protein gene protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a direct interaction between cyclin-dependent kinase 4 protein and proliferation associated protein gene protein. The passage discusses the effects of Msx1 overexpression on various cell cycle-related proteins and genes, but it does not specifically describe an interaction between these two particular proteins.  The context mentions that Msx1 overexpression leads to: 1. Suppression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (among other cell cycle regulators) 2. Suppression of proliferation associated protein gene (as observed in cDNA expression array analysis)  While both of these proteins/genes are affected by Msx1 overexpression, there is no information provided about their interaction with each other. They appear to be separately regulated by Msx1, but without evidence of a direct interaction between them.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no explicit mention of an interaction, the context does not provide enough information to completely rule out the possibility of an indirect relationship or interaction between these two proteins in the broader context of cell cycle regulation.
562723 2A2652867 2A2592321	microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain-3B	protein-3	[INST]Context: [PMID: 28537848 BACKGROUND: Mitophagy is a form of autophagy for the elimination of mitochondria. Mitochondrial content and function are reduced in the skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Physical training has been shown to restore mitochondrial capacity in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, but the role of mitophagy has not been examined in this context. This study analyzes the impact of a 3-month endurance training on important skeletal muscle mitophagy regulatory proteins and oxidative phosphorylation complexes in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. METHODS: Muscle biopsies were obtained from eight overweight/obese type 2 diabetes mellitus men (61+-10 years) at T1 (6 weeks pre-training), T2 (1 week pre-training), and T3 (3 to 4 days post-training). The protein contents of mitophagy regulatory proteins (phosphorylated form of forkhead box O3A (pFOXO3A), mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase-1 (MUL1), Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kD interacting protein-3 (BNIP3), microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain-3B (the ratio LC3B-II/LC3B-I was determined)) did not differ significantly between T1, T2, and T3. CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that training-induced changes in oxidative phosphorylation subunits (significant increase in complex II) are not accompanied by changes in mitophagy regulatory proteins in type 2 diabetes mellitus men. Future studies should elucidate whether acute exercise might affect mitophagic processes in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (and whether a transient regulation of mitophagy regulatory proteins is evident) to fully clarify the role of physical activity and mitophagy for mitochondrial health in this particular patient group.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain-3B protein] and [protein-3 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain-3B protein and protein-3 protein. The text mentions both proteins, but they are listed as separate mitophagy regulatory proteins being measured in the study. There is no indication of a direct interaction or relationship between these two specific proteins.  The context states: "The protein contents of mitophagy regulatory proteins (phosphorylated form of forkhead box O3A (pFoxo3A), mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase-1 (MUL1), Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kD interacting protein-3 (BNIP3), microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain-3B (the ratio LC3B-II/LC3B-I was determined)) did not differ significantly between T1, T2, and T3."  This passage lists these proteins as separate entities being measured, without suggesting any interaction between them. However, given the limited information provided and the complexity of cellular processes, it's not possible to completely rule out any potential interaction, which is why I've assigned a low confidence to this assessment.
169401 2A2764298 2A2529968	Nras	Ezh2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 27135738 An oncogenic Ezh2 mutation induces tumors through global redistribution of histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation. B cell lymphoma and melanoma harbor recurrent mutations in the gene encoding the EZH2 histone methyltransferase (EZH2), but the carcinogenic role of these mutations is unclear. Here we describe a mouse model in which the most common somatic Ezh2 gain-of-function mutation (EZH2(Y646F) in human; Ezh2(Y641F) in mouse) is conditionally expressed. Expression of Ezh2(Y641F) in mouse B cells or melanocytes caused high-penetrance lymphoma or melanoma, respectively. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, but not the oncoprotein Myc, or loss of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (encoded by Trp53 in mice) further accelerated lymphoma progression. Expression of the mutant Braf but not the mutant Nras oncoprotein further accelerated melanoma progression. These results suggest that Ezh2(Y641F) induces lymphoma and melanoma through a vast reorganization of chromatin structure, inducing both repression and activation of polycomb-regulated loci. Mice.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Nras protein] and [Ezh2 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no clear indication of a direct interaction between the Nras protein and the Ezh2 protein. The passage mentions both proteins, but in separate contexts:  1. Ezh2 is discussed as the main focus of the study, with a specific mutation (Y641F) being investigated for its role in inducing lymphoma and melanoma.  2. Nras is mentioned briefly as a comparison point, stating that expression of mutant Braf accelerated melanoma progression, while mutant Nras did not.  These proteins are not described as interacting with each other or having any combined effects. Instead, they appear to be involved in separate pathways or processes related to cancer progression. The lack of a described interaction and the separate contexts in which they are mentioned suggest that there is no direct interaction between Nras and Ezh2 proteins based on this information.  However, the confidence is rated as medium because the context provided is limited, and there could potentially be interactions between these proteins that are not mentioned in this specific passage or that have been discovered in other research not referenced here.
565428 2A2672324 2A2836821	MYO10	RPS27	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34175335 The periphilin 1-like BFAR isoform 3 is highly expressed in transcriptionally silent oocytes and involved in RNA metabolism. The mouse 3110001I22Rik gene located in the first intron of Bfar is considered as a Bfar variant coding for the BFARv3 protein. However, it differs from other BFAR isoforms and resembles periphilin 1 (PPHLN1) due to its two (Lge1 and serine-rich) conserved domains. We identified the BFARv3/EGFP-interacting proteins by co-immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry, which revealed 40S ribosomal proteins (RPS3, RPS14, RPS19, RPS25, RPS27), histones (H1.2, H1.4, H3.3C), proteins involved in RNA processing and splicing (SFPQ, SNRPA1, HNRNPA3, NONO, KHDRBS3), calcium signaling (HPCAL1, PTK2B), as well as HSD17B4, GRB14, POSTN, and MYO10. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that both Lge1 and Ser-rich domains of BFARv3 were necessary for binding to RNA-interacting factors NONO and SFPQ, known to be components of paraspeckles. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and the proximity ligation assay confirmed that both BFARv3 and PPHLN1 could interact with NONO and SFPQ, suggesting a new function for PPHLN1 as well. We found an accumulation of BFARv3/EGFP (but not its mutated forms) in the nuclear granules, which was enhanced in response to arsenite treatment and ionizing radiation. Although Bfar v3 is expressed ubiquitously in mouse tissues, its expression is the highest in metaphase II oocytes. The BFARv3 interactome suggests its role in RNA metabolism, which is critical for the transcriptionally silent MII oocyte. Mouse BFARv3 has no ortholog in the human genome, thus it may contribute to the differences between these two species observed in oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. Mice.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [MYO10 protein] and [RPS27 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a direct interaction between MYO10 protein and RPS27 protein. Both proteins are listed among the BFARv3/EGFP-interacting proteins identified through co-immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry, but this does not necessarily mean they interact with each other.   The context lists various proteins that interact with BFARv3/EGFP, including RPS27 (a 40S ribosomal protein) and MYO10, but it does not provide any information about interactions between these two specific proteins. They are simply part of a larger list of proteins that interact with BFARv3/EGFP.  The confidence is low because while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, the possibility of an interaction cannot be completely ruled out based solely on this information. Further research would be needed to definitively determine if MYO10 and RPS27 interact with each other.
490928 2A2895182 2A2418243	TFIID	Noxa	[INST]Context: [PMID: 35361962 Loss of TAF8 causes TFIID dysfunction and p53-mediated apoptotic neuronal cell death. Mutations in genes encoding general transcription factors cause neurological disorders. Despite clinical prominence, the consequences of defects in the basal transcription machinery during brain development are unclear. We found that loss of the TATA-box binding protein-associated factor TAF8, a component of the general transcription factor TFIID, in the developing central nervous system affected the expression of many, but notably not all genes. Taf8 deletion caused apoptosis, unexpectedly restricted to forebrain regions. Nuclear levels of the transcription factor p53 were elevated in the absence of TAF8, as were the mRNAs of the pro-apoptotic p53 target genes Noxa, Puma and Bax. The cell death in Taf8 forebrain regions was completely rescued by additional loss of p53, but Taf8 and p53 brains failed to initiate a neuronal expression program. Taf8 deletion caused aberrant transcription of promoter regions and splicing anomalies. We propose that TAF8 supports the directionality of transcription and co-transcriptional splicing, and that failure of these processes causes p53-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells in the developing mouse embryo.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [TFIID protein] and [Noxa protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct interaction mentioned between the TFIID protein and the Noxa protein. However, there are indirect connections that can be inferred:  1. TFIID is a general transcription factor complex, of which TAF8 is a component. 2. Loss of TAF8 affects TFIID function and leads to changes in gene expression. 3. In the absence of TAF8 (and thus, impaired TFIID function), the mRNA levels of Noxa (among other p53 target genes) are elevated.  While this information suggests a potential indirect relationship between TFIID and Noxa through the TAF8-p53 pathway, it does not provide evidence of a direct interaction between TFIID and Noxa proteins. The relationship described is more of a regulatory cascade rather than a physical interaction between the two proteins.  The confidence level is medium because while the context provides clear information about the roles of both TFIID and Noxa in the described biological process, it does not explicitly state or rule out a direct interaction between them.
250114 2A2458996 2A2601113	CD48	IL33	[INST]Context: [PMID: 30306094 Evaluation of Soluble CD48 Levels in Patients with Allergic and Nonallergic Asthma in Relation to Markers of Type 2 and Non-Type 2 Immunity: An Observational Study. CD48 is a costimulatory receptor associated with human asthma. We aimed to assess the significance of the soluble form of CD48 (sCD48) in allergic and nonallergic asthma. Volunteer patients completed an asthma and allergy questionnaire, spirometry, methacholine challenge test, a common allergen skin prick test, and a complete blood count. SCD48, IgE, IL5, IL17A, IL33, and IFNgamma were quantitated in serum by ELISA. Asthma was defined as positive methacholine challenge test or a 15% increase in FEV1 post bronchodilator in symptomatic individuals. Allergy was defined as positive skin test or IgE levels___>___200___IU/l in symptomatic individuals. 137 individuals participated in the study: 82 (60%) were diagnosed with asthma of which 53 (64%) was allergic asthma. SCD48 levels were significantly elevated in patients with nonallergic asthma compared to control and to the allergic asthma cohort (median (IQR) pg/ml, 1487 (1338-1758) vs. 1308 (1070-1581), p < 0.01, and 1336 (1129-1591), p = 0.02, respectively). IL17A, IL33, and IFNgamma levels were significantly elevated in allergic and nonallergic asthmatics when compared to control. No correlation was found between sCD48 level and other disease markers. Additional studies are required for understanding the role of sCD48 in airway disease.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CD48 protein] and [IL33 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between CD48 protein and IL33 protein. The study mentions both proteins, but they are discussed separately and in different contexts:  1. CD48 is described as a costimulatory receptor associated with human asthma, and its soluble form (sCD48) is the main focus of the study.  2. IL33 is mentioned as one of several cytokines (along with IL5, IL17A, and IFNgamma) that were measured in the serum of patients.  The study reports that IL33 levels were significantly elevated in both allergic and nonallergic asthmatics compared to controls. However, there is no information provided about any direct interaction or relationship between CD48 and IL33.  The context also explicitly states that "No correlation was found between sCD48 level and other disease markers," which would include IL33.  Given the limited information and lack of direct evidence for interaction, we cannot conclude that CD48 and IL33 interact. However, the confidence is low because the study did not specifically investigate the relationship between these two proteins, and there might be interactions that were not explored or reported in this particular context.
104956 2A2576391 2A2601220	beta-globin	interleukin 6	[INST]Context: [PMID: 2813429 Combination of interleukins 3 and 6 preserves stem cell function in culture and enhances retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells. The effects of several hematopoietic growth factors on primitive murine bone marrow progenitor cells [colony-forming unit(s)-spleen (CFU-S)] have been investigated during culture for 2-6 days. Interleukin 3 was required for CFU-S survival in culture, and the combination of interleukin 3 and interleukin 6 increased the number of CFU-S in culture 10-fold over the number obtained with interleukin 3 alone. Interleukin 3 was required, and interleukin 3 and interleukin 6 appear to act synergistically to enhance stem cell recovery from these cultures. These data appear to be relevant for retroviral-mediated gene transfer into stem and progenitor cells. Murine bone marrow cells were infected with a retrovirus containing the human beta-globin gene in the presence of various growth factors. Only 2 of 17 mice reconstituted with cells infected in the presence of interleukin 3 alone showed long-term expression of the human beta-globin gene (12 months), as opposed to 6 of 11 mice reconstituted with cells infected in the presence of interleukin 3 and interleukin 6. Medium conditioned by 5637 bladder carcinoma cells, a source of several hematopoietic growth factors, increased the frequency of infection of CFU-S but did not enhance stem cell infection or the repopulating potential of cultured bone marrow cells. Stem cells containing the human beta-globin provirus from these animals were shown to be capable of reconstituting secondary recipients in which the human beta-globin gene was expressed.

Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between beta-globin protein and interleukin 6 protein. The context discusses the effects of interleukin 3 and interleukin 6 on hematopoietic stem cells and their role in enhancing retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of the human beta-globin gene. However, it does not mention any direct interaction between the beta-globin protein and interleukin 6 protein.  The study focuses on how interleukin 3 and interleukin 6 affect stem cell survival, recovery, and gene transfer efficiency. While both beta-globin and interleukin 6 are mentioned in the context, they are discussed in separate capacities:  1. Beta-globin is mentioned as the gene being transferred into stem cells via retroviral infection. 2. Interleukin 6 is discussed as a growth factor that, in combination with interleukin 3, enhances stem cell recovery and improves gene transfer efficiency.  There is no indication that these two proteins directly interact with each other at a molecular level. Instead, they appear to be involved in separate processes within the overall experimental setup.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, the possibility of an indirect relationship or interaction not mentioned in this specific study cannot be completely ruled out without a more comprehensive review of the literature.
288225 2A2514431 2A2943709	DYNLL1	CSE1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 31465861 XPO1 is a critical player for bortezomib resistance in multiple myeloma: A quantitative proteomic approach. Among the blood cancers, 13% mortality is caused by Multiple myeloma type of hematological malignancy. In spite of therapeutic advances in chemotherapy treatment, still multiple myeloma remains an incurable disease is mainly due to emergence of chemoresistance. At present time, FDA approved bortezomib is the first line drug for multiple myeloma treatment. However, like other chemotherapy, multiple myeloma patients are acquiring resistance against bortezomib. The present study aims to identify and validate bortezomib resistant protein targets in multiple myeloma using iTRAQ and label free quantitative proteomic approaches. Exportin-1 (XPO1) protein was selected for further validation as its significant high expression was observed in both iTRAQ and label free analysis. Bioinformatic analysis of these common differentially expressed proteins showed a clear cluster of proteins such as SMC1A, RCC2, CSE1, NUP88, NUP50, TPR, HSPA14, DYNLL1, RAD21 and RANBP2 being associated with XPO1. Functional studies like cell count assay, flow cytometry assay and soft agar assay proved that XPO1 knock down in RPMI 8226R cell line results in re-sensitization to bortezomib drug. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Multiple myeloma is a type of hematological malignancy which constitutes about 13% of all blood cell related malignancies. Chemoresistance is one of the major obstacles for the successful treatment for multiple myeloma. Bortezomib is a first proteasome inhibitor drug, widely used in multiple myeloma treatment. The present study aims to identify and validate bortezomib resistant protein targets in multiple myeloma. Here, we identified 112 candidate proteins to be associated with bortezomib resistance using global quantitative proteomic analysis. Among these candidate proteins, we show that XPO1 plays crucial role in emerging bortezomib resistance using functional studies like cell count assay, flow cytometry assay and soft agar assay. XPO1 could be a potential therapeutic target for multiple myeloma and development of inhibitors of XPO1 might help to cure multiple myeloma.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [DYNLL1 protein] and [CSE1 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence to suggest that DYNLL1 and CSE1 proteins interact with each other, albeit indirectly. The passage states:  "Bioinformatic analysis of these common differentially expressed proteins showed a clear cluster of proteins such as SMC1A, RCC2, CSE1, NUP88, NUP50, TPR, HSPA14, DYNLL1, RAD21 and RANBP2 being associated with XPO1."  This statement indicates that both DYNLL1 and CSE1 are part of a cluster of proteins associated with XPO1. While there is no direct mention of interaction between DYNLL1 and CSE1 specifically, their shared association with XPO1 and inclusion in the same protein cluster suggests a functional relationship or interaction within the same biological pathway.  The confidence level is medium because: 1. The interaction is not explicitly stated but inferred from their shared association with XPO1. 2. They are listed together in a cluster of proteins, implying a functional relationship. 3. However, the exact nature of their interaction or the strength of their association is not specified in the given context.  Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that DYNLL1 and CSE1 proteins likely interact or are functionally related in the context of bortezomib resistance in multiple myeloma, but further research would be needed to confirm the specific nature of their interaction.
313644 2A2863516 2A2861717	Skp1	Sgt1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 20404110 Hsp90-Sgt1 and Skp1 target human Mis12 complexes to ensure efficient formation of kinetochore-microtubule binding sites. The Hsp90-Sgt1 chaperone complex is important for this process; However, its targets are not conserved and its exact contribution to kinetochore assembly is unclear. Here, we show that human Hsp90-Sgt1 interacts with the Mis12 complex, a so-called keystone complex required to assemble a large fraction of the kinetochore. Inhibition of Hsp90 or Sgt1 destabilizes the Mis12 complex and delays proper chromosome alignment due to inefficient formation of microtubule-binding sites. Interestingly, coinhibition of Sgt1 and the SCF subunit, Skp1, increases Mis12 complexes at kinetochores and restores timely chromosome alignment but forms less-robust microtubule-binding sites. We propose that a balance of Mis12 complex assembly and turnover is required for the efficient and accurate assembly of kinetochore-microtubule binding sites.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Skp1 protein] and [Sgt1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence suggesting that Skp1 and Sgt1 proteins interact or are functionally related in the process of kinetochore assembly, although their interaction is not explicitly stated. The key points supporting this conclusion are:  1. The context mentions "coinhibition of Sgt1 and the SCF subunit, Skp1," indicating that these two proteins are being considered together in the experimental setup.  2. The coinhibition of Sgt1 and Skp1 leads to a specific outcome: it "increases Mis12 complexes at kinetochores and restores timely chromosome alignment but forms less-robust microtubule-binding sites."  3. This shared effect on the Mis12 complex and chromosome alignment suggests that Sgt1 and Skp1 are working in a related pathway or process.  While the text doesn't explicitly state a direct physical interaction between Skp1 and Sgt1, their functional relationship in the context of kinetochore assembly and the fact that they are studied together in the coinhibition experiment suggests some level of interaction or cooperation.  The confidence level is medium because while there is evidence of a functional relationship, a direct physical interaction is not explicitly stated, and more information would be needed to determine the exact nature of their interaction.
419893 2A2536414 2A2548752	FEN1	GADD45A	[INST]Context: [PMID: 28893156 Erythrosine B and quinoline yellow dyes regulate DNA repair gene expression in human HepG2 cells. Erythrosine B is a cherry pink food colorant and is widely used in foods, drugs, and cosmetics. Quinoline yellow is a chinophthalon derivative used in cosmetic compositions for application to the skin, lips, and/or body surface. Previously, erythrosine b and quinoline yellow synthetic dyes were found to induce DNA damage in HepG2 cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular basis underlying the genotoxicity attributed to erythrosine b and quinoline yellow using the RT2 Profiler polymerase chain reaction array and by analyzing the expression profile of 84 genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair in HepG2 cells. Erythrosine b (70 mg/L) significantly decreased the expression of two genes ( FEN1 and REV1) related to DNA base repair. One gene ( LIG1) was downregulated and 20 genes related to ATR/ATM signaling ( ATR, RBBP8, RAD1, CHEK1, CHEK2, TOPB1), nucleotide excision repair ( ERCC1, XPA), base excision repair ( FEN1, MBD4), mismatch repair ( MLH1, MSH3, TP73), double strand break repair ( BLM), other DNA repair genes ( BRIP1, FANCA, GADD45A, REV1), and apoptosis ( BAX, PPP1R15A) were significantly increased after treatment with quinoline yellow (20 mg/L).

While both proteins are involved in DNA repair processes, the information provided does not suggest any direct interaction or relationship between them. They are simply listed as being affected by different treatments.  Given the limited information and lack of any statement about their interaction, we cannot conclude that these proteins interact. However, due to the possibility that there might be some unknown relationship between these DNA repair-related proteins that is not mentioned in this specific context, I've assigned a low confidence to this answer.

Pathways enrichment analysis using the GO database reveals a large group of proteins which take part in keratinization processes (CASP14, DSG1, DSP, JUP, and so on). Nine proteins (including KRT2, KRT9, KRT1, KRT10, KRT14, DCD, KRT6C, KRT6A, and KRT5) were detected in all three groups. A two-sample Welch's t-test identified a significant change in KRT2 and KRT9 levels after landing. Enrichment analysis using the KEGG database revealed the significant participation of detected proteins in pathogenic E. coli infection (ACTG1, TUBA1C, TUBA4A, TUBB, TUBB8, and YWHAZ), which may indicate microbiota changes associated with being in space. In general, the results suggest that exhaled breath condensate can be used for noninvasive monitoring of health status and respiratory tract pathologies during spaceflights, and that the obtained data are important for the development of medicine for use in extreme situations.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence  Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information indicating that TUBA4A protein and KRT9 protein interact with each other. The passage mentions both proteins, but in different contexts:  1. TUBA4A is listed among proteins involved in pathogenic E. coli infection, as revealed by KEGG database enrichment analysis.  2. KRT9 is mentioned as one of the nine proteins detected in all three groups of the study, and its levels were found to change significantly after landing.  However, the text does not provide any direct evidence of interaction between these two proteins. They appear to be involved in different processes or pathways based on the information given.  The low confidence in this answer stems from the limited information provided in the context. While there's no indication of interaction, it's possible that these proteins could interact in ways not mentioned in this specific excerpt. A more comprehensive analysis of protein interactions would be needed to definitively rule out any potential interaction between TUBA4A and KRT9.
581818 2A2459937 2A2547361	p27kip1	Cdh1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 26963853 TGF-beta activates APC through Cdh1 binding for Cks1 and Skp2 proteasomal destruction stabilizing p27kip1 for normal endometrial growth. We previously reported that aberrant TGF-beta/Smad2/3 signaling in endometrial cancer leads to continuous ubiquitylation of p27(kip1) by the E3 ligase SCF-Skp2/Cks1 causing its degradation, as a putative mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of this cancer. In contrast, normal intact TGF-beta signaling prevents degradation of nuclear p27(kip1) by SCF-Skp2/Cks1 thereby accumulating p27(kip1) to block Cdk2 for growth arrest. Here we show that in endometrial cancer cell lines and normal primary endometrial epithelial cells, TGF-beta increases Cdh1 and its binding to APC/C to form the E3 ligase complex that ubiquitylates Cks1 and Skp2 prompting their proteasomal degradation and thus, leaving p27(kip1) intact. Knocking-down Cdh1 in endometrial cancer cell lines increased Skp2/Cks1 E3 ligase activity, completely diminished nuclear and cytoplasmic p27(kip1), and obviated TGF-beta-mediated inhibition of proliferation. Protein synthesis was not required for TGF-beta-induced increase in nuclear p27(kip1) and decrease in Cks1 and Skp2. Moreover, half-lives of Cks1 and Skp2 were extended in the Cdh1-depleted cells. These results suggest that the levels of p27(kip1), Skp2 and Cks1 are strongly or solely regulated by proteasomal degradation. Finally, an inverse relationship of low p27(kip1) and high Cks1 in the nucleus was shown in patients in normal proliferative endometrium and grade I-III ECAs whereas differentiated secretory endometrium showed the reverse. These studies implicate Cdh1 as the master regulator of TGF-beta-induced preservation of p27(kip1) tumor suppressor activity. Thus, Cdh1 is a potential therapeutic target for endometrial cancer and other human cancers showing an inverse relationship between Cks1/Skp2 and p27(kip1) and/or dysregulated TGF-beta signaling.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [p27kip1 protein] and [Cdh1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of an interaction between p27kip1 protein and Cdh1 protein. However, they are both part of a regulatory pathway involving TGF-beta signaling and proteasomal degradation.  The context describes that:  1. Cdh1 binds to APC/C to form an E3 ligase complex that ubiquitylates Cks1 and Skp2. 2. The degradation of Cks1 and Skp2 leads to the preservation of p27kip1. 3. Cdh1 is described as the "master regulator of TGF-beta-induced preservation of p27kip1 tumor suppressor activity."  While Cdh1 plays a crucial role in regulating the levels of p27kip1, there is no direct interaction mentioned between these two proteins. Instead, Cdh1 influences p27kip1 levels indirectly by targeting the proteins (Cks1 and Skp2) responsible for p27kip1 degradation.  The confidence level is medium because, although there is no direct interaction mentioned, the two proteins are closely linked in the same regulatory pathway, which could potentially lead to confusion about their relationship.
256578 2A2837915 2A2836821	rpS3a	ribosomal protein S27	[INST]Context: [PMID: 23379559 Proteins of the human 40S ribosomal subunit involved in hepatitis C internal ribosome entry site binding as revealed from fluorescent labeling. Initiation of translation of genomic RNA of hepatitis C virus is provided by a highly structured fragment in its 5'-untranslated region, the so-called Internal Ribosome Entry Site . In this work, the exposed NH2-groups of proteins in the 40S subunit of the human ribosome and in its binary complexes with RNA transcripts corresponding to the full-size hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site or its fragments were probed using the N-hydroxysuccinimide derivative of the fluorescent dye Cy3. Comparison of efficiencies of modification of ribosomal proteins in free subunits and in their binary complexes with the RNA transcripts revealed ribosomal proteins involved in the hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site binding. It was found that binding of the 40S subunits with the RNA transcript corresponding to full-size hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site results in a decrease in modification levels of ribosomal protein S27 and, to a lesser extent of rpS10; When a fragment of hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site containing the initial part of the open reading frame of the viral genomic rna was deleted, the level of rpS10 modification became the same as in free subunits, whereas the levels of modification of rpS27 and the RACK1/S2/S3a group remained virtually unchanged compared to those observed in the complex of 40S subunit with the full-size hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site. Binding of 40S subunits to a fragment of the hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site lacking an open reading frame and domain II increased the modification level of the RACK1/S2/S3a proteins, while the efficiencies of labeling of rpS10 and rpS27 remained the same as upon the deletion of the open reading frame fragment. Comparison of these results with known structural and biochemical data on the organization of 40S subunit and the location of the hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site on it revealed structural elements of the internal ribosome entry site contacting exposed lysine residues of the above-mentioned ribosomal proteins. Thus, it was found that the majority of exposed lysine residues of rpS27 are involved in the binding of the hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site region formed by the junction of subdomains IIIa, IIIb, and IIIc with the central stalk of domain III, and that several lysine residues of rpS10 participate in the binding of the hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site region corresponding to the initial part of the open reading frame of the viral genomic rna. In addition, we concluded that lysine residues of rpS3a are involved in the binding of domains II and III of hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [rpS3a protein] and [ribosomal protein S27 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between rpS3a protein and ribosomal protein S27 protein. The text discusses how these proteins are affected by the binding of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to the 40S ribosomal subunit, but it does not indicate that these proteins interact with each other.  The context mentions that:  1. Binding of the full-size HCV IRES results in a decrease in modification levels of ribosomal protein S27. 2. Lysine residues of rpS3a are involved in the binding of domains II and III of HCV IRES.  While both proteins are involved in binding different parts of the HCV IRES, there is no mention of direct interaction between rpS3a and S27. They appear to be separate components of the 40S ribosomal subunit that interact with different regions of the HCV IRES.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no explicit mention of interaction between these two proteins, the context does not provide enough information to completely rule out the possibility of some indirect interaction or proximity within the ribosomal complex.

The accumulation of amyloid Tau aggregates is implicated in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Molecular chaperones are known to maintain protein homeostasis. Here, we show that an ATP-dependent human chaperone system disassembles Tau fibrils in vitro We found that this function is mediated by the core chaperone HSC70, assisted by specific cochaperones, in particular class B J-domain proteins and a heat shock protein 110 -type nucleotide exchange factor . The Hsp70 disaggregation machinery processed recombinant fibrils assembled from all six Tau isoforms as well as Sarkosyl-resistant Tau aggregates extracted from cell cultures and human alzheimer's disease brain tissues, demonstrating the ability of the Hsp70 machinery to recognize a broad range of Tau aggregates. However, the chaperone activity released monomeric and small oligomeric Tau species, which induced the aggregation of self-propagating Tau conformers in a Tau cell culture model. We conclude that the activity of the Hsp70 disaggregation machinery is a double-edged sword, as it eliminates Tau amyloids at the cost of generating new seeds.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [HSC70 protein] and [Hsp70 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, HSC70 and Hsp70 appear to be interacting or closely related proteins within the same chaperone system. The passage mentions "the core chaperone HSC70" as part of the "Hsp70 disaggregation machinery," suggesting that HSC70 is a component of the broader Hsp70 system.  The text states that "an ATP-dependent human chaperone system disassembles Tau fibrils in vitro" and then specifies that "this function is mediated by the core chaperone HSC70, assisted by specific cochaperones." Later, it refers to this system as the "Hsp70 disaggregation machinery."  This suggests that HSC70 is a key component of the Hsp70 system, working together with other proteins to perform the disaggregation function. While they are not explicitly described as directly interacting, their functional relationship within the same chaperone system implies a form of interaction or cooperation.  The confidence level is medium because the interaction is not explicitly stated, but rather inferred from the functional relationship described in the text. A higher confidence level would require more direct evidence of physical or functional interaction between HSC70 and other Hsp70 proteins.

We aim to establish a comprehensive COVID-19 autoantigen atlas in order to understand autoimmune diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the unique affinity between dermatan sulfate and autoantigens, we identified 348 proteins from human lung A549 cells, of which 198 are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with current COVID data identified 291 proteins that are altered at protein or transcript level in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 191 being known autoantigens. These known and putative autoantigens are significantly associated with viral replication and trafficking processes, including gene expression, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, mRNA metabolism, translation, vesicle and vesicle-mediated transport, and apoptosis. They are also associated with cytoskeleton, platelet degranulation, IL-12 signaling, and smooth muscle contraction. Orf3 induces the largest number of protein alterations, Orf9 affects the mitochondrial ribosome, and they and E, M, N, and Nsp proteins affect protein localization to membrane, immune responses, and apoptosis. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination alterations by viral infection define major molecular changes in autoantigen origination.

The passage lists these proteins among others as "new targets for future investigation," but does not describe any direct relationship or interaction between them.   Both UCHL1 and SLC2A1 are mentioned in a list of proteins that may be relevant to COVID-19 autoimmunity, but the text does not provide any information about how these proteins might interact with each other. They are simply presented as part of a larger group of proteins of interest.

Explanation: The provided context does not explicitly mention any direct interaction between FTH1 protein and SOD2 protein. Both proteins are mentioned in the study, but they are discussed in separate contexts:  1. SOD2 is reported to be downregulated in the autistic group compared to controls. 2. FTH1 is mentioned as being downregulated in severe autistic patients compared to mild/moderate autistic patients.  While both proteins are related to oxidative stress and are discussed in the context of autism, there is no information provided about their interaction with each other. The study focuses on the expression levels of these proteins in different groups rather than on their potential interactions.  Given the limited information provided and the lack of any statement about their interaction, we cannot conclude that FTH1 and SOD2 proteins interact with each other based on this context. However, it's important to note that this doesn't mean they don't interact at all; it just means that this particular study doesn't provide evidence for or discuss such an interaction.
363970 2A2866725 2A2571820	SOD2	GSTP1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 32905960 Usefulness of current candidate genetic markers to identify childhood cancer patients at risk for platinum-induced ototoxicity: Results of the European PanCareLIFE cohort study. BACKGROUND: Irreversible sensorineural hearing loss is a common side effect of platinum treatment with the potential to significantly impair the neurocognitive, social and educational development of childhood cancer survivors. Genetic association studies suggest a genetic predisposition for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Among other candidate genes, thiopurine methyltransferase is considered a critical gene for susceptibility to cisplatin-induced hearing loss in a pharmacogenetic guideline. METHODS: Eligibility criteria required patients to be aged less than 19 years at the start of chemotherapy, which had to include cisplatin and/or carboplatin. Patients were assigned to three phenotype categories: no, minor and clinically relevant hearing loss. Fourteen variants in eleven candidate genes (ABCC3, OTOS, thiopurine methyltransferase, SLC22A2, NFE2L2, SLC16A5, LRP2, GSTP1, SOD2, WFS1 and ACYP2) were investigated. RESULTS: 900 patients were included in this study. In the multinomial logistic regression, significant unique contributions were found from SLC22A2 rs316019, the age at the start of platinum treatment, cranial radiation and the interaction term [platinum compound]___[cumulative dose of cisplatin]. CONCLUSIONS: PanCareLIFE is the largest study of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity to date and confirmed a role for the polyspecific organic cation transporter SLC22A2. However, the predictive value of the current genetic candidate markers for clinical use is negligible, which puts the value of clinical factors for risk assessment of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity back into the foreground.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SOD2 protein] and [GSTP1 protein] interact with each other?

707257 2A2475316 2A2630432	cofilin 1	lamin A/C	[INST]Context: [PMID: 21569507 Identification of new autoantibody specificities directed at proteins involved in the transforming growth factor beta pathway in patients with systemic sclerosis. INTRODUCTION: Antinuclear antibodies, usually detected by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells, are identified in 90% of patients with systemic sclerosis . Thus, approximately 10% of systemic sclerosis patients have no routinely detectable autoantibodies, and for 20% to 40% of those with detectable antinuclear antibodies, the antinuclear antibodies do not have identified specificity (unidentified ANAs). In this work, we aimed to identify new target autoantigens in systemic sclerosis patients. METHODS: Using a proteomic approach combining two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting with HEp-2 cell total and enriched nuclear protein extracts as sources of autoantigens, we systematically analysed autoantibodies in systemic sclerosis patients. Sera from 45 systemic sclerosis patients were tested in 15 pools from groups of three patients with the same phenotype. A sera pool from 12 healthy individuals was used as a control. Interestingly, alpha-enolase was recognised by immunoglobulin G from all pools of patients in both extracts. Fourteen and four proteins were recognised by immunoglobulin g from at least 75% of the 15 pools in total and enriched nuclear protein extracts, respectively, whereas 15 protein spots were specifically recognised by immunoglobulin g from at least four of the ten pools from patients with unidentified antinuclear antibodies. The immunoglobulin g intensity for a number of antigens was higher in sera from patients than in sera from healthy controls. These antigens included triosephosphate isomerase, superoxide dismutase mitochondrial precursor, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L and lamin A/C. In addition, peroxiredoxin 2, cofilin 1 and calreticulin were specifically recognised by sera from phenotypic subsets of patients with unidentified antinuclear antibodies. Interestingly, several identified target antigens were involved in the transforming growth factor beta pathway. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several new target antigens shared among patients with systemic sclerosis or specific to a given phenotype. The specification of new autoantibodies could help in understanding the pathophysiology of systemic sclerosis. Moreover, these autoantibodies could represent new diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for systemic sclerosis.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [cofilin 1 protein] and [lamin A/C protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of any interaction between cofilin 1 protein and lamin A/C protein. These proteins are mentioned separately in the text as potential new target autoantigens identified in systemic sclerosis patients.   Cofilin 1 is mentioned as being "specifically recognised by sera from phenotypic subsets of patients with unidentified antinuclear antibodies," while lamin A/C is listed among proteins for which "the immunoglobulin g intensity ... was higher in sera from patients than in sera from healthy controls."  However, the text does not provide any information about these proteins interacting with each other or having any related functions. They are simply listed as separate findings from the study. Given the limited information provided and the lack of any statement about their interaction, we cannot conclude that these proteins interact.  The low confidence is due to the possibility that these proteins might interact in ways not mentioned in this specific context, but based solely on the information provided, there is no evidence of interaction.
43302 2A2918856 2A2763771	CTs	RAMP 3	[INST]Context: [PMID: 10385705 Multiple amylin receptors arise from receptor activity-modifying protein interaction with the calcitonin receptor gene product. Receptor activity-modifying proteins are single-transmembrane proteins that transport the calcitonin receptor-like receptor to the cell surface. RAMP 1-transported calcitonin receptor-like receptor is a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. RAMP 2- or RAMP 3-transported calcitonin receptor-like receptor is an adrenomedullin receptor. The role of receptor activity-modifying proteins beyond their interaction with calcitonin receptor-like receptor, a class II G protein-coupled receptor, is unclear. In this study, we have examined the role of receptor activity-modifying proteins in generating amylin receptor phenotypes from the calcitonin receptor gene product. Cotransfection of RAMP 1 or RAMP 3 with the human calcitonin receptor lacking the 16-amino acid insert in intracellular domain 1 (hCTRI1-) into COS-7 cells induced specific 125I-labeled rat amylin binding. RAMP 2 or vector cotransfection did not cause significant increases in specific amylin binding. Competition-binding characterization of the RAMP-induced amylin receptors revealed two distinct phenotypes. The RAMP 1-derived amylin receptor demonstrated the highest affinity for salmon calcitonin (IC50, 3.01 +/- 1.44 x 10(-10) M), a high to moderate affinity for rat amylin (IC50, 7.86 +/- 4.49 x 10(-9) M) and human CGRPalpha (IC50, 2.09 +/- 1.63 x 10(-8) M), and a low affinity for human calcitonin (IC50, 4.47 +/- 0.78 x 10(-7) M). In contrast, whereas affinities for amylin and the CTs were similar for the RAMP 3-derived receptor, the efficacy of human CGRPalpha was markedly reduced (IC50, 1.12 +/- 0.45 x 10(-7) M; P <.05 versus RAMP 1). Functional cyclic AMP responses in COS-7 cells cotransfected with individual receptor activity-modifying proteins and hCTRI1- were reflective of the phenotypes seen in competition for amylin binding. Confocal microscopic localization of c-myc-tagged RAMP 1 indicated that, when transfected alone, RAMP 1 almost exclusively was located intracellularly. Cotransfection with calcitonin receptor I1- induced cell surface expression of RAMP 1. The results of experiments cross-linking 125I-labeled amylin to RAMP 1/hCTR-transfected cells with bis succidimidyl suberate were suggestive of a cell-surface association of RAMP 1 and the receptors. Our data suggest that in the calcitonin family of receptors, and potentially in other class II G protein-coupled receptors, the cellular phenotype is likely to be dynamic in regard to the level and combination of both the receptor and the RAMP proteins.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: The context suggests that RAMP 3 protein interacts with the calcitonin receptor (CT receptor), which is part of the CT family of proteins. Specifically:  1. The study examined "the role of receptor activity-modifying proteins in generating amylin receptor phenotypes from the calcitonin receptor gene product."  2. It states that "Cotransfection of RAMP 1 or RAMP 3 with the human calcitonin receptor lacking the 16-amino acid insert in intracellular domain 1 (hCTRI1-) into COS-7 cells induced specific 125I-labeled rat amylin binding."  3. The context describes a "RAMP 3-derived receptor" with specific binding affinities for amylin and CTs (calcitonins).  4. The study suggests that "in the calcitonin family of receptors, and potentially in other class II G protein-coupled receptors, the cellular phenotype is likely to be dynamic in regard to the level and combination of both the receptor and the RAMP proteins."  These points indicate that RAMP 3 protein interacts with the calcitonin receptor, which is part of the CT family of proteins. However, the interaction is not explicitly described in as much detail as for RAMP 1, hence the medium confidence level.

The present work was aimed to study the dose and time dependent cytotoxic effects of Russell's viper venom on human A549 cells grown in vitro. As small gtpase play pivotal roles in deciding the cellular morphology, polarity, cell movement and overall signaling cascade. It was shown for the first time that expression patterns of Rac, Rho and CDC42 genes are altered on exposure to russell's viper venom. Similarly, significant difference in the expression pattern of HSP70 and p53 at the mRNA levels were noted. Our results confirmed that russell's viper venom induces apoptosis in A549 cells; This was further confirmed by AO/EtBr staining as well as caspase-3 assay. We propose for the first time that russell's viper venom induces morphological changes in human A549 cells through modulation of smGTPase expression and affects the cellular-nuclear architecture which in turn interferes in proliferation and migration of these cells along with apoptosis.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a direct interaction between HSP70 protein and CDC42 protein. The text discusses that the expression patterns of both HSP70 and CDC42 (along with other proteins like Rac and Rho) are altered when exposed to Russell's viper venom. However, this does not necessarily indicate that these proteins interact with each other.  The context suggests that these proteins are part of the cellular response to the venom, but they are mentioned separately:  1. CDC42 is mentioned as part of the small GTPases (along with Rac and Rho) that play roles in cellular morphology, polarity, and signaling.  2. HSP70 is mentioned separately, along with p53, as having altered expression patterns at the mRNA level in response to the venom.  While both proteins are affected by the venom, there is no information provided about any direct interaction between HSP70 and CDC42. They appear to be part of different cellular processes affected by the venom, but not necessarily interacting with each other.  The confidence is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, the possibility of an interaction cannot be completely ruled out based solely on this information.
74365 2A2909421 2A2764443	transferrin	Rab 27	[INST]Context: [PMID: 15632015 Melanocyte-specific proteins are aberrantly trafficked in melanocytes of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome-type 3. Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome-type 3 is a relatively mild subtype of HPS with minimal cutaneous and ocular depigmentation. The hermansky-pudlak syndrome-type 3 gene encodes a novel protein of unknown function with a predicted molecular weight of 114 kd. To assess the role of the HPS3 protein in melanization, cultured melanocytes developed from hermansky-pudlak syndrome-type 3 patients were evaluated biochemically and histologically for activity and localization of melanocyte-specific proteins. Endogenous tyrosinase activity of hermansky-pudlak syndrome-type 3 melanocytes was substantial, but tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis was suppressed in intact melanocytes. However, the level of suppression, as well as extent to which up-regulation by isobutylmethylxanthine and cholera toxin was muted, was less that in HPS-1 melanocytes. Dihydroxyphenylalanine histochemistry demonstrated an increase in melanization of melanosomes. Unique to hermansky-pudlak syndrome-type 3 melanocytes were numerous DOPA-positive 50-nm vesicles and tubular elements present throughout the cell body and dendrites. Tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1, dopachrome tautomerase, and LAMP1 and 3 localization in hermansky-pudlak syndrome-type 3 melanocytes, as evaluated by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy, demonstrated a fine, floccular distribution in contrast to the coarse, granular distribution characteristic of control melanocytes. The localization profile of other proteins expressed by melanocytes (ie, Silver/Pmel17, Melan-A/MART-1, LAMP2, Rab 27, transferrin, c-kit, adaptin-3, and the HPS1 protein) appeared normal. These results suggest that a specific subset of melanocyte proteins are aberrantly trafficked throughout the hermansky-pudlak syndrome-type 3 melanocyte and may be responsible for the reduction in melanin synthesis.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [transferrin protein] and [Rab 27 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between transferrin protein and Rab 27 protein. The passage mentions both proteins, but only in the context of their localization in Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome-type 3 (HPS-3) melanocytes:  "The localization profile of other proteins expressed by melanocytes (ie, Silver/Pmel17, Melan-A/MART-1, LAMP2, Rab 27, transferrin, c-kit, adaptin-3, and the HPS1 protein) appeared normal."  This statement suggests that both transferrin and Rab 27 proteins have normal localization in HPS-3 melanocytes, but it does not indicate any interaction between them. The proteins are simply listed together as examples of proteins whose localization is not affected in HPS-3 melanocytes.  The low confidence in this answer stems from the fact that while no interaction is mentioned, the context does not provide exhaustive information about all possible protein interactions. There could potentially be interactions between these proteins that are not discussed in this specific passage.
624652 2A2576061 2A2897492	alpha-globin	alpha-globin transcription factor CP2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 8349681 Characterization of the molecularly cloned murine alpha-globin transcription factor CP2. We recently cloned human and murine cDNAs that encode CP2, a transcription factor that interacts with the murine alpha-globin promoter. In this report, we exploited our ability to express CP2 in bacteria and eukaryotic cells to further investigate factor activities in vitro and in vivo. CP2 expressed in bacteria was significantly enriched and used in a series of DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic gel shift assays. The results suggest that CP2 binds a hyphenated recognition sequence motif that spans one DNA helix turn. In addition, the enriched bacterial protein activated transcription of alpha-globin promoter templates approximately 3- to 4-fold in vitro. We then tested the effect of elevating CP2 levels 2.5- to 5.5-fold in vivo using both transient and stable transformation assays. When a reporter construct comprised of the intact murine alpha-globin promoter driving the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was introduced into these overexpressing cells, we observed a 3- to 6-fold increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity when compared to cells expressing normal levels of CP2. These results define the CP2 factor binding site in more detail and help characterize the activities of the factor in vivo. Mice.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [alpha-globin protein] and [alpha-globin transcription factor CP2 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence suggesting an interaction between the alpha-globin protein and the alpha-globin transcription factor CP2 protein, although it is not explicitly stated. Here are the key points supporting this interaction:  1. CP2 is described as a transcription factor that interacts with the murine alpha-globin promoter. This suggests a regulatory relationship between CP2 and the alpha-globin gene.  2. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic gel shift assays showed that CP2 binds to a specific recognition sequence motif in the DNA, which is likely part of the alpha-globin promoter.  3. CP2 was shown to activate transcription of alpha-globin promoter templates approximately 3- to 4-fold in vitro.  4. In vivo experiments demonstrated that overexpression of CP2 led to a 3- to 6-fold increase in activity of a reporter construct driven by the murine alpha-globin promoter.  While these points strongly suggest an interaction between CP2 and the alpha-globin gene, the interaction is primarily at the DNA level (with the promoter) rather than directly with the alpha-globin protein itself. The transcription factor CP2 is regulating the expression of the alpha-globin gene, which in turn leads to the production of the alpha-globin protein.  Given this indirect relationship and the lack of explicit mention of a direct protein-protein interaction between CP2 and alpha-globin, I've assigned a medium confidence level to this interaction.

Genomic alterations such as chromosomal amplifications, deletions and loss of heterozygosity play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of cancer. In this current study, Affymetrix 10K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays were used to evaluate genomic alterations in 20 pairs of matched germ-line and tumor DNA obtained from patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma from high-risk area of India where tobacco, betel quid and alcohol use are widespread. The candidate genes located at amplified regions of chromosomes or low-level gain regions such as PLA2G5 (1p36-p34), COL11A1 (1p21), KCNK2 (1q41), S100A3 (1q21), ENAH (1q42.12), RGS1 (1q31), KCNH1 (1q32-q41), INSIG2 (2q14.1), FGF12 (3q28), TRIO (5p15.2), RNASEN (5p15.2), FGF10 (5p13-p12), EDN1(6p24.1-p22.3), SULF1 (8q13.2-13.3), TLR4 (9q32-q33), TNC (9q33), NTRK2 (9q22.1), CD44 (11p13), NCAM1 (11q23.1), TRIM29 (11q22-q23), PAK1 (11q13-q14) and RAB27A (15q15-q21.1), are found to be associated with cellular migration and proliferation, tumor cell metastasis and invasion, anchorage independent growth and inhibition of apoptosis. The candidate genes located at deleted regions of chromosomes, such as FBLN2 (3p25.1), WNT7A (3p25), DLC1 (8p22), LZTS1 (8p22), CDKN2A (9p21), COL4A1 (13q34), CDK8 (13q12) and DCC (18q21.3), are found to be associated with the suppression of tumor. The suggested candidate genes were mostly involved in potential signaling pathways such as focal adhesion (COL4A1), tight junction (CLDN10), MAPK signaling pathway (FGF12) and neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway (CCKAR). Expression of FGF12 and COL4A1 was validated by tissue microarray. These unique copy number alteration profiles should be taken into consideration when developing biomarkers for the early detection of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in high-risk areas of India in association with tobacco and betel quid use.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of any interaction between WNT7A protein and RGS1 protein. The context lists these proteins as being associated with different chromosomal regions and potentially different functions:  1. WNT7A is mentioned as a candidate gene located in a deleted region of chromosome 3p25. 2. RGS1 is mentioned as a candidate gene located in an amplified or low-level gain region of chromosome 1q31.  These proteins are not described as interacting with each other or being involved in the same biological processes. They are simply listed among other genes found to be altered in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma samples.

102766 2A2704682 2A2763386	P53	HsRAD51	[INST]Context: [PMID: 10767546 P53 splice acceptor site mutation and increased HsRAD51 protein expression in Bloom's syndrome GM1492 fibroblasts. GM1492 human diploid skin fibroblasts derived from a patient with Bloom's syndrome, lack detectable p53 mRNA and protein as shown by Northern and Western blotting, and express an increased RecA-like activity. Here we demonstrate that the p53 gene is grossly intact in GM1492 cells according to Southern blotting. DNA sequencing did not reveal any mutations in the promoter region of p53. A highly sensitive RT-PCR produced a p53 cDNA fragment that was shorter than expected. DNA sequence analysis of p53 cDNA showed that exon 6 was missing, explaining the shorter PCR product. Furthermore, sequencing of genomic DNA revealed a base substitution at the nucleotide preceding the AG splice acceptor site of intron 5. The aberrant transcript is predicted to encode a truncated p53 protein containing 189 amino acid residues. Moreover, Western blotting demonstrated elevated HsRAD51 protein levels in GM1492 cells. The lack of sufficient levels of wild-type p53 and increased levels of HsRad51 protein may contribute to the elevated RecA-like activity in the GM1492 fibroblasts.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [P53 protein] and [HsRAD51 protein] interact with each other?

Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between P53 protein and HsRAD51 protein. The text discusses these proteins separately and does not indicate any direct interaction or combined effect between them.  The context mentions that GM1492 fibroblasts lack detectable p53 mRNA and protein, and have an increased RecA-like activity. It also states that these cells have elevated HsRAD51 protein levels. However, the relationship between these observations is not presented as a direct interaction between P53 and HsRAD51 proteins.  The text suggests that the lack of sufficient wild-type p53 and increased levels of HsRad51 protein may both contribute to the elevated RecA-like activity in GM1492 fibroblasts, but this does not imply a direct interaction between the two proteins. Rather, it suggests that these two separate factors may independently influence the RecA-like activity.  While there might be an indirect relationship between these proteins in the context of cellular processes, the provided information does not explicitly state or strongly imply a direct interaction between P53 and HsRAD51 proteins.
707718 2A2497730 2A2779376	DDB1	ROC1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 21795677 Cullin 4B protein ubiquitin ligase targets peroxiredoxin III for degradation. Cullin 4B is a scaffold protein that assembles cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (E3) complexes. Recent studies have revealed that germ-line mutations in cullin 4b can cause mental retardation, short stature, and many other abnormalities in humans. Identifying specific cullin 4b substrates will help to better understand the physiological functions of cullin 4b. Here, we report the identification of peroxiredoxin III as a novel substrate of the cullin 4b ubiquitin ligase complex. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry showed that peroxiredoxin iii was among the proteins up-regulated in cells after RNAi-mediated cullin 4b depletion. The impaired degradation of peroxiredoxin iii observed in cullin 4b knockdown cells was confirmed by Western blot. We further demonstrated that DDB1 and ROC1 in the DDB1-CUL4B-ROC1 complex are also indispensable for the proteolysis of peroxiredoxin iii. In addition, the degradation of peroxiredoxin iii is independent of CUL4A, a cullin family member closely related to cullin 4b. In vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays revealed that cullin 4b promoted the polyubiquitination of peroxiredoxin iii. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in cellular reactive oxygen species production in CUL4B-silenced cells, which was associated with increased resistance to hypoxia and H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. These findings are discussed with regard to the known function of peroxiredoxin iii as a reactive oxygen species scavenger and the high endogenous reactive oxygen species levels required for neural stem cell proliferation. Together, our study has identified a specific target substrate of cullin 4b ubiquitin ligase that may have significant implications for the pathogenesis observed in patients with mutations in cullin 4b.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [DDB1 protein] and [ROC1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence.   Explanation: The context strongly suggests that DDB1 and ROC1 proteins interact with each other as part of the same protein complex. Specifically, the passage states:  "We further demonstrated that DDB1 and ROC1 in the DDB1-CUL4B-ROC1 complex are also indispensable for the proteolysis of peroxiredoxin iii."  This sentence directly indicates that DDB1 and ROC1 are both components of the same complex (DDB1-CUL4B-ROC1) and that they work together in the degradation of peroxiredoxin III. The fact that they are described as being part of the same complex and both being necessary for the proteolysis of peroxiredoxin III strongly implies a functional interaction between these two proteins.  Furthermore, the context describes this complex as a cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (E3) complex, which typically involves multiple interacting proteins working together to facilitate protein ubiquitination. This further supports the interaction between DDB1 and ROC1 within this functional complex.  Given this clear description of DDB1 and ROC1 as part of the same functional complex and their joint role in protein degradation, we can conclude with high confidence that these proteins interact with each other.

Recent whole genome analyses suggested associations between nonsyndromic orofacial cleft and up to 18 genetic risk loci (ABCA4, BMP4, CRISPLD2, GSTT1, FGF8, FGFR2, FOXE1, IRF6, MAFB, MSX1, MTHFR, MYH9, PDGFC, PVRL1, SUMO1, TGFA, TGFB3, and VAX1), each of which confers a different relative risk in different populations. Ion torrent personal genome machine data processing, including alignment with the human genome build 19 reference genome (hg19), base calling, trimming of barcoded adapter sequences, and filtering of poor signal reads, was performed using the IT platform-specific pipeline software Torrent Suite, version 4.2, with the plug-in 'variant caller' program. Benign or tolerated amino acid changes were excluded after analysis using sorting intolerant from tolerant and polymorphism phenotyping. Furthermore, each variant was confirmed in asymptomatic controls using the Sequenom MassARRAY (San Diego, CA, USA). RESULTS: We identified totally 22 types of nonsynonymous variants specific in nonsyndromic orofacial clefts, including 19 single nucleotide variants, 2 deletions, and 1 duplication in 10 studied genes(ABCA4, MYH9, MTHFR, CRISPLD2, FGF8, PVRL1, FOXE1, VAX1, FGFR2, and IRF6). Nonsynonymous variants in MYH9 and ABCA4, which were detected in 6 and 5 individuals, respectively, were identified to be the most frequent risk loci in nonsyndromic orofacial clefts in the Taiwanese population. CONCLUSIONS: Nonsynonymous variants in MYH9 and ABCA4 were identified to be the most frequent risk loci in nonsyndromic orofacial clefts in the Taiwanese population.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SUMO1 protein] and [MYH9 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of an interaction between SUMO1 protein and MYH9 protein. The text lists both SUMO1 and MYH9 among 18 genetic risk loci associated with nonsyndromic orofacial cleft, but it does not describe any specific interaction between these two proteins.   The study focuses on identifying nonsynonymous variants in various genes associated with orofacial clefts in the Taiwanese population. While MYH9 is mentioned as one of the most frequent risk loci identified in the study, SUMO1 is only listed as part of the 18 genetic risk loci and is not discussed further in the results or conclusions.  Given the lack of specific information about any interaction between SUMO1 and MYH9 proteins, we cannot conclude that they interact based on this context alone. However, the confidence is low because the absence of evidence in this particular study does not necessarily mean that these proteins do not interact in other contexts or studies not mentioned here.
12592 2A2640132 2A2510834	EB3	drebrin	[INST]Context: [PMID: 22275434 Apico-basal elongation requires a drebrin-E-EB3 complex in columnar human epithelial cells. Although columnar epithelial cells are known to acquire an elongated shape, the mechanisms involved in this morphological feature have not yet been completely elucidated. Using columnar human intestinal Caco2 cells, it was established here that the levels of drebrin E, an actin-binding protein, increase in the terminal web both in vitro and in vivo during the formation of the apical domain. Drebrin E depletion was found to impair cell compaction and elongation processes in the monolayer without affecting cell polarity or the formation of tight junctions. Decreasing the drebrin E levels disrupted the normal subapical F-actin-myosin-IIB-betaII-spectrin network and the apical accumulation of EB3, a microtubule-plus-end-binding protein. Decreasing the EB3 levels resulted in a similar elongation phenotype to that resulting from depletion of drebrin E, without affecting cell compaction processes or the pattern of distribution of F-actin-myosin-IIB. In addition, EB3, myosin IIB and betaII spectrin were found to form a drebrin-E-dependent complex. Taken together, these data suggest that this complex connects the F-actin and microtubule networks apically during epithelial cell morphogenesis, while drebrin E also contributes to stabilizing the actin-based terminal web.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [EB3 protein] and [drebrin protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

The context strongly indicates that EB3 protein and drebrin protein interact with each other. Specifically:  1. The text mentions "a drebrin-E-EB3 complex," which directly suggests an interaction between these two proteins.  2. It states that "Decreasing the drebrin E levels disrupted the normal subapical F-actin-myosin-IIB-betaII-spectrin network and the apical accumulation of EB3," indicating that drebrin E affects the localization of EB3.  3. The passage notes that "EB3, myosin IIB and betaII spectrin were found to form a drebrin-E-dependent complex," further supporting the interaction between drebrin E and EB3.  4. The conclusion states that "this complex connects the F-actin and microtubule networks apically during epithelial cell morphogenesis," suggesting that drebrin E and EB3 work together in this process.  These points provide strong evidence for a direct interaction between the EB3 protein and drebrin protein in the context of epithelial cell morphogenesis and apico-basal elongation.

To identify potential novel biomarkers for mycosis fungoides at the tumor stage, a genomic mapping of 41 cutaneous lymphoma biopsies was used to explore for significant genes.The gene expression profiling datasets of mycosis fungoides were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). Significant diseases genetic terminologies associated with tumor stage mycosis fungoides were found in black module. Subsequently, 13 hub genes including CFLAR, GCNT2, IFNG, IL17A, IL22, MIP, PLCG1, PTH, PTPN6, REG1A, SNAP25, SUPT7L, and TP63 were shown to be related to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia .In summary, in addition to the reported genes (IL17F, PLCG1, IFNG, and PTH) in CTCL/ATLL, the other high instable genes may serve as novel biomarkers for the regulation of the biological processes and molecular mechanisms of CTLT (MF/SS).] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SNAP25 protein] and [PTPN6 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between SNAP25 protein and PTPN6 protein. The context lists these two proteins among 13 hub genes related to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia, but it does not describe any specific interaction or relationship between them.  The text merely identifies these genes as potentially important in the context of mycosis fungoides and related lymphomas, but it does not provide any information about how they might interact with each other or influence each other's function. Without more specific information about their relationship, we cannot conclude that these two proteins interact.  The confidence level is low because while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, it's possible that such interactions could exist but are simply not mentioned in this particular study or summary.
215541 2A2851467 2A2400850	RXRalpha	FABPpm	[INST]Context: [PMID: 24262292 Effect of pre-existing maternal obesity, gestational diabetes and adipokines on the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of maternal obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus and adipokines on the expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake, transport, synthesis and metabolism. MATERIALS/METHODS: Human subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues were obtained from lean, overweight and obese normal glucose tolerant women and women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Adipose tissue explants were performed to determine the effect of the adipokines TNFalpha, IL-1beta and leptin on adipose tissue gene expression. RESULTS: Pre-existing maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus are associated with decreased expression in genes involved in fatty acid uptake and intracellular transport (LPL, FATP2, FATP6, FABPpm and ASCL1), triacylglyceride biosynthesis (MGAT1,7 MGAT2 and DGAT1), lipogenesis (FASN) and lipolysis (PNPLA2, HSL and MGLL). Decreased gene expression was also observed for the transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism (LXRalpha, PPARalpha, PPARdelta, PPARgamma, RXRalpha and SREBP1c). On the other hand, the gene expression of the adipokines TNFalpha, IL-1beta and or leptin was increased in adipose tissue from obese and gestational diabetes mellitus women. Functional in vitro studies revealed that these adipokines decreased the gene expression of LPL, FATP2, FATP6, ASCL1, PNPLA2, PPARdelta, PPARgamma and RXRalpha. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancies complicated by pre-existing maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus are associated with abnormal adipose tissue lipid metabolism, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Mothers.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [RXRalpha protein] and [FABPpm protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a direct interaction between RXRalpha protein and FABPpm protein. The text discusses both proteins, but they are mentioned in separate contexts:  1. RXRalpha is mentioned as one of the transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism whose gene expression is decreased in adipose tissue from obese and gestational diabetes mellitus women.  2. FABPpm is listed among the genes involved in fatty acid uptake and intracellular transport whose expression is decreased in the same conditions.  While both proteins are affected by the same conditions (maternal obesity and gestational diabetes), there is no information provided about any direct interaction between them. They appear to be part of related processes in lipid metabolism, but the text does not suggest they interact with each other directly.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, the possibility of an interaction cannot be completely ruled out based solely on this information. A more comprehensive study focused specifically on these two proteins would be needed to definitively state whether they interact or not.
626972 2A2943709 2A2905922	CSE1L	FAS	[INST]Context: [PMID: 33602168 Mining prognostic markers of Asian hepatocellular carcinoma patients based on the apoptosis-related genes. BACKGROUND: Apoptosis-related genesplay an essential role in the occurrence and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, few studies have focused on the prognostic significance of apoptosis-related genes in hepatocellular carcinoma. In the study, we aim to explore an efficient prognostic model of Asian hepatocellular carcinoma patients based on the apoptosis-related genes. METHODS: We downloaded mRNA expression profiles and corresponding clinical data of Asian hepatocellular carcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium databases. The apoptosis-related genes were collected from Deathbase, a database related to cell death, combined with the research results of GeneCardsa__National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases and a lot of literature. We used Wilcoxon-test and univariate Cox analysis to screen the differential expressed genes and the prognostic related genes of hepatocellular carcinoma. The intersection genes of differential expressed genes and PGGs were seen as crucial apoptosis-related genes of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prognostic model of Asian hepatocellular carcinoma patients was constructed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso)- proportional hazards model (Cox) regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier curve, Principal Component Analysis analysis, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding analysis, risk score curve, receiver operating characteristic curve, and the hepatocellular carcinoma data of international cancer genome consortium database and the data of Asian hepatocellular carcinoma patients of Kaplan-Meier plotter database were used to verify the model. RESULTS: A total of 20 of 56 apoptosis-related genes were differentially expressed between hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent normal tissues (p___<___0.05). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that 10 of 56 apoptosis-related genes were associated with survival time and survival status of hepatocellular carcinoma patients (p___<___0.05). There are seven overlapping genes of these 20 and 10 genes, including BAK1, BAX, BNIP3, CRADD, CSE1L, FAS, and SH3GLB1. Through Lasso-Cox analysis, an hepatocellular carcinoma prognostic model composed of BAK1, BNIP3, CSE1L, and FAS was constructed. CONCLUSIONS: Lasso-Cox regression analysis identified a 4-gene prognostic model, which integrates clinical and gene expression and has a good effect. The expression of apoptosis-related genes is related to the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients, but the specific mechanism remains to be further verified.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CSE1L protein] and [FAS protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of an interaction between CSE1L protein and FAS protein. The text only states that both CSE1L and FAS are part of a group of apoptosis-related genes that were found to be differentially expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and associated with patient survival. They are both included in the final 4-gene prognostic model, but this does not necessarily imply a direct interaction between these two proteins.  The study focuses on identifying prognostic markers rather than exploring protein-protein interactions. Without additional information about how these proteins might functionally relate to each other, we cannot conclude that they interact. Therefore, while they are part of the same prognostic model, there is insufficient evidence in the given context to suggest a direct interaction between CSE1L and FAS proteins.
127695 2A2880698 2A2884721	GluProRS	LysRS	[INST]Context: [PMID: 23536245 The stepwise emergence of those new domains is consistent with their involvement in a broad range of biological functions beyond protein synthesis, and correlates with the increasing biological complexity of higher organisms. While some of the domains are uniquely found in aaRSs and may have originated from nucleic acid binding motifs, others are common domain modules mediating protein-protein interactions that play a critical role in the assembly of the multi-synthetase complex . Interestingly, the multi-synthetase complex has emerged from a miniature complex in yeast to a large stable complex in humans. The human multi-synthetase complex consists of nine aaRSs (LysRS, ArgRS, GlnRS, AspRS, MetRS, IleRS, LeuRS, GluProRS, and bifunctional aaRs) and three scaffold proteins (AIMP1/p43, AIMP2/p38, and AIMP3/p18), and has a molecular weight of 1.5 million Dalton. The multi-synthetase complex has been proposed to have a functional dualism: facilitating protein synthesis and serving as a reservoir of non-canonical functions associated with its synthetase and non-synthetase components. In fact, alternative conformations of aaRSs have been generated by various mechanisms from proteolysis to alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications, as well as by disease-causing mutations. Therefore, the metamorphosis between different conformational states is connected to the activation and regulation of the novel functions of aaRSs in higher eukaryotes.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GluProRS protein] and [LysRS protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, GluProRS and LysRS are likely to interact with each other, though their direct interaction is not explicitly stated. The evidence supporting this interaction is as follows:  1. Both GluProRS and LysRS are mentioned as part of the human multi-synthetase complex, which consists of nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) and three scaffold proteins.  2. The context states that the multi-synthetase complex has a molecular weight of 1.5 million Dalton, suggesting that its components are closely associated.  3. The text mentions that the multi-synthetase complex facilitates protein synthesis and serves as a reservoir of non-canonical functions associated with its synthetase components.  4. The context also discusses protein-protein interactions that play a critical role in the assembly of the multi-synthetase complex.  While there is no explicit statement of direct interaction between GluProRS and LysRS, their presence in the same complex and the nature of the complex's functions strongly suggest that these proteins interact with each other as part of the larger multi-synthetase complex. However, without a direct statement of their interaction, we cannot be entirely certain, hence the medium confidence level.
127193 2A2590057 2A2712591	EL52	P4HB	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34557019 Background: Ischemic cardiomyopathy and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy are the two most common causes of heart failure. However, our understanding of the specific proteins and biological processes distinguishing dilated cardiomyopathy from ischemic cardiomyopathy remains insufficient. Materials and Methods: The proteomics analyses were performed on serum samples from ischemic cardiomyopathy (n=5), dilated cardiomyopathy (n=5), and control (n=5) groups. Proteomics and bioinformatics analyses, including weighted gene co-expression network analysis and gene set enrichment analysis, were performed to identify the hub circulating proteins and the hub biological processes in ischemic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Results: The analysis of differentially expressed proteins and weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified the hub circulating proteins in ischemic cardiomyopathy (GAPDH, CLSTN1, VH3, CP, and ST13) and dilated cardiomyopathy (one downregulated protein, FGG; 18 upregulated proteins, including HEL-S-276, IGK, ALDOB, HIST1H2BJ, HEL-S-125m, RPLP2, EL52, NCAM1, P4HB, HEL-S-99n, HIST1H4L, HIST2H3PS2, F8, ERP70, SORD, PSMA3, PSMB6, and PSMA6). The mRNA expression of the heart specimens from GDS651 validated that ALDOB, GAPDH, RPLP2, and IGK had good abilities to distinguish dilated cardiomyopathy from ischemic cardiomyopathy. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis results showed that cell proliferation and differentiation were the hub biological processes related to ischemic cardiomyopathy, while metabolic processes and cell signaling transduction were the hub biological processes associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. Conclusion: The present study identified five dysregulated hub circulating proteins among ischemic cardiomyopathy patients and 19 dysregulated hub circulating proteins among dilated cardiomyopathy patients. Metabolic processes were strongly enhanced in dilated cardiomyopathy and may be used to distinguish dilated cardiomyopathy from ischemic cardiomyopathy.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [EL52 protein] and [P4HB protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between EL52 protein and P4HB protein. Both proteins are listed among the 18 upregulated proteins in dilated cardiomyopathy, but the text does not describe any specific relationship or interaction between them. They are simply part of a list of proteins that were found to be upregulated in the same condition.  However, it's important to note that the absence of explicit information about their interaction doesn't necessarily mean they don't interact. They could potentially be involved in the same biological processes or pathways, especially since they are both upregulated in the same condition. But without more specific information, we cannot conclude that they interact.  The confidence is low because while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, the possibility of an interaction cannot be completely ruled out based solely on this information.
551563 2A2610838 2A2513318	cytokeratin 8	DVL3	[INST]Context: [PMID: 33003551 Investigating Radiotherapy Response in a Novel Syngeneic Model of Prostate Cancer. The prostate cancer field lacks clinically relevant, syngeneic mouse models which retain the tumour microenvironment observed in prostate cancer patients. This study establishes a cell line from prostate tumour tissue derived from the Pten-/-/trp53-/- mouse, termed DVL3 which when subcutaneously implanted in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, forms tumours with distinct glandular morphology, strong cytokeratin 8 and androgen receptor expression, recapitulating high-risk localised human prostate cancer. Compared to the commonly used TRAMP C1 model, generated with SV40 large T-antigen, DVL3 tumours are immunologically cold, with a lower proportion of CD8+ T-cells, and high proportion of immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells, thus resembling high-risk prostate cancer. Furthermore, DVL3 tumours are responsive to fractionated RT, a standard treatment for localised and metastatic prostate cancer, compared to the TRAMP C1 model. RNA-sequencing of irradiated DVL3 tumours identified upregulation of type-1 interferon and STING pathways, as well as transcripts associated with myeloid derived suppressor cells. Upregulation of STING expression in tumour epithelium and the recruitment of myeloid derived suppressor cells following irradiation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The DVL3 syngeneic model represents substantial progress in preclinical prostate cancer modelling, displaying pathological, micro-environmental and treatment responses observed in molecular high-risk disease. Our study supports using this model for development and validation of treatments targeting prostate cancer, especially novel immune therapeutic agents.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [cytokeratin 8 protein] and [DVL3 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: The context provided does not explicitly mention any direct interaction between cytokeratin 8 protein and DVL3 protein. The passage describes the DVL3 cell line as expressing cytokeratin 8, but this does not imply an interaction between the two proteins.  Cytokeratin 8 is mentioned as a marker expressed by the DVL3 tumors, along with androgen receptor expression. This suggests that cytokeratin 8 is used as a characteristic feature to describe the tumors formed by the DVL3 cell line, rather than indicating any interaction with the DVL3 protein itself.  The DVL3 mentioned in the context appears to be the name of the cell line derived from prostate tumor tissue, not necessarily referring to a specific protein. Without more information explicitly stating an interaction between cytokeratin 8 and a DVL3 protein, we cannot conclude that they interact.  Given the limited information provided about these specific proteins and their potential relationships, the confidence in this assessment is low. More detailed biochemical or molecular studies would be needed to determine if there is any direct interaction between these proteins.
128298 2A2450658 2A2908767	CA12	TRAILR3	[INST]Context: [PMID: 17158757 Identification of novel genes that co-cluster with estrogen receptor alpha in breast tumor biopsy specimens, using a large-scale real-time reverse transcription-PCR approach. The estrogen receptor alpha plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and clinical behavior of breast cancer. To obtain further insights into the molecular basis of estrogen-dependent forms of this malignancy, we used real-time quantitative reverse transcription -PCR to compare the mRNA expression of 560 selected genes in ERalpha-positive and ERalpha-negative breast tumors. In addition to well-known ERalpha-induced genes (PGR, TFF1/PS2, BCL2, ERBB4, CCND1, etc.) and genes recently identified by cDNA microarray-based approaches (GATA3, TFF3, MYB, STC2, HPN/HEPSIN, FOXA1, XBP1, SLC39A6/LIV-1, etc.), an appreciable number of novel genes were identified, many of, which were weakly expressed. Most of the new genes identified here encoded secreted proteins (SEMA3B and CLU), growth factors (BDNF, FGF2 and EGF), growth factor receptors (IL6ST, PTPRT, RET, VEGFR1 and FGFR2) or metabolic enzymes (CYP2B6, CA12, ACADSB, NAT1, LRBA, SLC7A2 and SULT2B1). Importantly, we also identified a large number of genes encoding proteins with either pro-apoptotic (PUMA, NOXA and TATP73) or anti-apoptotic properties (BCL2, DNTP73 and TRAILR3). Surprisingly, only a small proportion of the 51 genes identified in breast tumor biopsy specimens were confirmed to be ERalpha-regulated and/or E2-regulated in vitro (cultured cell lines). Therefore, this study identified a limited number of genes and signaling pathways, which better delineate the role of estrogen receptor alpha in breast cancer.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CA12 protein] and [TRAILR3 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between CA12 protein and TRAILR3 protein. The text mentions both proteins, but they are listed as part of different groups of genes identified in the study:  1. CA12 is mentioned as one of the metabolic enzymes identified: "Most of the new genes identified here encoded secreted proteins (SEMA3B and CLU), growth factors (BDNF, FGF2 and EGF), growth factor receptors (IL6ST, PTPRT, RET, VEGFR1 and FGFR2) or metabolic enzymes (CYP2B6, CA12, ACADSB, NAT1, LRBA, SLC7A2 and SULT2B1)."  2. TRAILR3 is mentioned as one of the anti-apoptotic proteins: "Importantly, we also identified a large number of genes encoding proteins with either pro-apoptotic (PUMA, NOXA and TATP73) or anti-apoptotic properties (BCL2, DNTP73 and TRAILR3)."  While both proteins are identified as being associated with estrogen receptor alpha-positive breast tumors, there is no information provided about any direct interaction or functional relationship between CA12 and TRAILR3. The low confidence in this answer stems from the limited information provided in the context and the possibility that interactions between these proteins might exist but are not mentioned in this particular study.

PURPOSE: The ocular vascular endothelium plays a key role in the development of several leading retinal causes of blindness in Western nations. Choroidal endothelial cells are integral to the subretinal neovascular lesions that characterize the exudative form of late age-related macular degeneration, and retinal endothelial cells participate in the initiation of diabetic retinopathy and posterior uveitis. Vascular endothelial cells at different sites exhibit considerable molecular diversity. Previous work from our group has identified significant differences in the gene transcript profiles of human retinal and choroidal endothelial cells. METHODS: Retinal and choroidal endothelial cells were separately isolated from five sets of human eyes by enzymatic digestion with type II collagenase followed by anti-CD31 antibody-conjugated magnetic bead separation. Cells were washed to remove serum peptides in the culture medium, and lysed by sonication in buffer containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Protein was then precipitated with acetone. Retinal and choroidal endothelial samples from each donor were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, mixed with a Cy2-labeled pooled protein sample to facilitate spot matching across gels, and separated by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Eleven proteins were more abundant in retinal endothelial cells (i.e., inorganic pyrophosphatase, protein disulfide isomerase A3, calreticulin, peroxiredoxin-4, protein disulfide isomerase, serpin B9, F-actin capping protein subunit beta, coactosin-like protein, vimentin, cathepsin B, and a high molecular weight form of annexin A3). Six proteins were more abundant in choroidal endothelial cells (i.e., glutathione peroxidase 1, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCH-L1), heat-shock protein beta-1, superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn), nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, and a low molecular weight form of annexin 3). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the proteomes of retinal and choroidal vascular endothelial cells are different. Several differentially expressed proteins are implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis; These include cathepsin B and UCH-L1, proteins with transcripts that were also differently expressed according to microarray. Our observations further suggest that angiogenesis within the retina, a component of severe diabetic retinopathy and posterior uveitis, may be controlled by different mechanisms to those regulating choroidal neovascularization, as occur in exudative age-related macular degeneration.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 protein] and [heat-shock protein beta-1 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct indication of interaction between ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCH-L1) protein and heat-shock protein beta-1 protein. The passage mentions both proteins as being more abundant in choroidal endothelial cells compared to retinal endothelial cells, but it does not describe any functional interaction or relationship between these two specific proteins.  The context focuses on comparing protein expression levels between retinal and choroidal endothelial cells, rather than describing interactions between individual proteins. While both UCH-L1 and heat-shock protein beta-1 are listed together as being more abundant in choroidal endothelial cells, this co-occurrence does not necessarily imply a direct interaction between them.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, the passage does not exhaustively describe all possible protein interactions, leaving open the possibility that these proteins might interact in ways not mentioned in this specific study.
385908 2A2907654 2A2417527	triosephosphate isomerase	adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein	[INST]Context: [PMID: 18156650 Proteomic analysis of human omental adipose tissue in the polycystic ovary syndrome using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. BACKGROUND: Our aim was to study the protein expression profiles of omental adipose tissue biopsies obtained from morbidly obese women with or without polycystic ovary syndrome at the time of bariatric surgery to evaluate the possible involvement of visceral adiposity in the development of polycystic ovary syndrome. METHODS: Ten polycystic ovary syndrome patients and nine control samples were included. We used two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) followed by in-gel digestion, and mass spectrometry of selected protein spots. RESULTS: The 2D-DIGE technology allowed the analysis of approximately 1840 protein spots in the comparative study of control and patient proteomes, revealing 15 statistically significant spot changes (>2-fold, P < 0.05). This preliminary study revealed differences in expression of proteins that may be involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, oxidative stress processes and adipocyte differentiation; They include proapolipoprotein Apo-A1, annexin V, glutathione S-transferase M3, triosephosphate isomerase, peroxiredoxin 2 isoform a, actin and adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein. The most relevant finding was an increase of glutathione s-transferase m3 in the omental fat of polycystic ovary syndrome patients confirming previous studies conducted by our group. CONCLUSIONS: Proteomic analysis of omental fat reveals differential expression of several proteins in polycystic ovary syndrome patients and non-hyperandrogenic women presenting with morbid obesity.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [triosephosphate isomerase protein] and [adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between triosephosphate isomerase and adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein. The text simply lists these proteins among others that showed differential expression in the omental adipose tissue of women with polycystic ovary syndrome compared to controls.   The study used proteomic analysis to identify proteins with altered expression levels, but it does not discuss any functional interactions or relationships between the identified proteins. Both triosephosphate isomerase and adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein are mentioned as part of a list of proteins that showed significant changes, but there is no information provided about how these proteins might interact with each other or work together in any biological process.  Given the limited information provided and the lack of any statement about interactions between these specific proteins, we cannot conclude that they interact. However, the confidence is low because the study was focused on identifying differentially expressed proteins rather than exploring protein-protein interactions, so the absence of mentioned interactions does not definitively rule out the possibility that such interactions could exist.

During tuberculosis cytokines play a role in host defence. To determine the cytokine pattern during various disease stages of tuberculosis, serum levels of IL-12, interferon-gamma, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 were measured in 81 patients with active tuberculosis, 15 patients during therapy and 26 patients after anti-tuberculous therapy as well as in 16 persons who had been in close contact with smear-positive tuberculosis and in 17 healthy controls. Interferon-gamma was elevated during active tuberculosis when compared with healthy controls, declining during and after treatment. IL-12 (p40 and p70) serum levels were not significantly higher in patients with active tuberculosis compared with any of the other groups. IL-6 and IL-10 serum levels were elevated in patients with active tuberculosis and during treatment. In patients with active tuberculosis serum levels of interferon-gamma and IL-6 were higher in patients with fever, anorexia and malaise. IL-12 levels were higher in patients with a positive smear. Cytokine levels did not correlate with localization of tuberculosis (pulmonary versus extrapulmonary), or skin test positivity. Cytokines directing a Th1 response (IL-12) or a Th2 response (IL-4) were not elevated in sera of this large group of patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of an interaction between p40 protein and Th1 protein. The abstract discusses various cytokines and their levels during different stages of tuberculosis, but it does not specifically describe any interaction between p40 and Th1 proteins.  The context mentions p40 as part of IL-12 (p40 and p70) serum levels, which were not significantly higher in patients with active tuberculosis compared to other groups. Th1 is mentioned in relation to the cytokine response, with IL-12 being described as a cytokine directing a Th1 response.  However, the text does not provide any information about a direct interaction between these two proteins. The low confidence is due to the limited information provided about these specific proteins and the lack of any statement suggesting their interaction.
574357 2A2734750 2A2532229	PPARalpha	FABP-4	[INST]Context: [PMID: 25326905 Irisin has no effect on lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes or fatty acid metabolism in HepG2 hepatocytes. Irisin, a newly identified myokine responsible for browning of white or beige adipocytes, has been reported to be present at reduced levels in diabetic patients and associated with obesity, serum triglyceride levels, and intrahepatic triglyceride levels. We wondered whether irisin could directly affect fatty acid and triglyceride metabolism in adipocytes and hepatocytes. We examined the effects of various concentrations of irisin on lipolysis (according to Oil Red O staining, free fatty acid release, and glycerol release), protein expression of HSL and ATGL, and mRNA expression of other lipid-related genes (UCP-1, PPARgamma, FABP-4, HSL, ATGL, PPARalpha, and CPT-1) in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as well as mRNA levels of genes involved in the synthesis (SREBP-1C and FAS) and beta-oxidation (PPARalpha and CPT-1) of fatty acids in HepG2 hepatocytes under physiological or hyperglycemic conditions. Our results revealed that although irisin significantly increased the mRNA levels of UCP-1 and PPARalpha, it failed to show detectable effects on lipolysis, HSL or ATGL protein levels, or the mRNA expression of other lipid-related genes in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In HepG2 hepatocytes, high glucose induced the upregulation of SREBP-1C and FAS and the downregulation of PPARalpha; However, no significant effect of irisin on gene expression was observed under either physiological or hyperglycemic conditions. We therefore conclude that irisin has no significant direct effect on lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes or on fatty acid metabolism in HepG2 hepatocytes.

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about a direct interaction between PPARalpha protein and FABP-4 protein. The text mentions both proteins in the context of gene expression studies, but it does not describe any functional or physical interaction between them.  The context discusses measuring mRNA expression levels of various lipid-related genes, including PPARalpha and FABP-4, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, the study focuses on the effects of irisin on these gene expression levels individually, rather than exploring interactions between the proteins encoded by these genes.  Given the limited information provided and the absence of any statement suggesting an interaction between PPARalpha and FABP-4 proteins, we cannot conclude that they interact. However, since the study does not explicitly state that they do not interact, and because both proteins are involved in lipid metabolism, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of an interaction. This is why the confidence level is low.
148269 2A2548823 2A2548822	G beta 1	G beta 2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 8804400 The G protein beta subunit Gpb1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a negative regulator of sexual development. A Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog of mammalian genes encoding G protein beta subunits, gpb1+, was cloned by the polymerase chain reaction using primer pairs that correspond to sequences conserved in several G beta genes of other species followed by screening of genomic and cDNA libraries. The gpb1 gene encodes 317 amino acids that show 47% homology with human G beta 1 and G beta 2 and 40% homology with Saccharomyces cerevisiae G beta protein. Disruption of the gpb1 gene indicated that this gene is not required for vegetative cell growth. However, gpb1-disrupted haploid cells mated and sporulated faster than wild-type cells, both in sporulation (MEA) and in complex medium (YE): when examined 23 h after transfer to sporulation medium, 35% of gpb1-disrupted haploid pairs had undergone conjugation and sporulation, whereas only 3-5% of wild-type haploid pairs had done so. Overexpression of the gpb1 gene suppressed this facilitated conjugation and sporulation phenotype of gpb1-disrupted cells but did not cause any obvious effect in wild-type cells. Co-disruption of one of the two S. pombe G alpha-subunit genes, gpa2, in the gpb1-disrupted cells did not change the accelerated conjugation and sporulation phenotype of the gpb1- cells. However, co-disruption of the ras1 gene abolished the gpb1- phenotype. These results suggest that Gpb1 is a negative regulator of conjugation and sporulation that apparently works upstream of Ras1 function in S. pombe. The possible relationship of Gpb1 to two previously identified, putative G alpha proteins of S. pombe is discussed.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [G beta 1 protein] and [G beta 2 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: The context does not provide any information about a direct interaction between G beta 1 protein and G beta 2 protein. These proteins are only mentioned in passing as a comparison point for the homology of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Gpb1 protein. Specifically, the text states: "The gpb1 gene encodes 317 amino acids that show 47% homology with human G beta 1 and G beta 2." This statement only indicates that the S. pombe Gpb1 protein shares some sequence similarity with both human G beta 1 and G beta 2 proteins, but it does not suggest any interaction between G beta 1 and G beta 2 themselves.  The low confidence is given because while there is no evidence of interaction in the provided context, the possibility of interaction between these proteins cannot be entirely ruled out based solely on this information. The text is focused on the S. pombe Gpb1 protein and its role in regulating sexual development, rather than on the interactions between human G beta proteins.
358277 2A2737439 2A2865768	parkin	synphilin-1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 12761037 Identification and functional characterization of a novel R621C mutation in the synphilin-1 gene in Parkinson's disease. Synphilin-1 is linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease based on its identification as an alpha-synuclein (PARK1) and parkin interacting protein. Moreover, synphilin-1 is a component of Lewy bodies in brains of sporadic parkinson's disease patients. Therefore, we performed a detailed mutation analysis of the synphilin-1 gene in 328 German familial and sporadic parkinson's disease patients. In two apparently sporadic parkinson's disease patients we deciphered a novel C to T transition in position 1861 of the coding sequence leading to an amino acid substitution from arginine to cysteine in position 621 (R621C). To define a possible role of mutant synphilin-1 in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease we performed functional analyses in SH-SY5Y cells. We found synphilin-1 capable of producing cytoplasmic inclusions in transfected cells. C621 synphilin-1 transfected cells were more susceptible to staurosporine-induced cell death than cells expressing wild-type synphilin-1. Our findings argue in favour of a causative role of the R621C mutation in the synphilin-1 gene in parkinson's disease and suggest that the formation of intracellular inclusions may be beneficial to cells and that a mutation in synphilin-1 that reduces this ability may sensitize neurons to cellular stress.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [parkin protein] and [synphilin-1 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: The context provides evidence that parkin protein and synphilin-1 protein interact with each other. Specifically, the text states: "Synphilin-1 is linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease based on its identification as an alpha-synuclein (PARK1) and parkin interacting protein."  This statement directly indicates that synphilin-1 interacts with parkin. The interaction between these two proteins is mentioned in the context of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, suggesting that this interaction may be biologically relevant.  However, the confidence level is set at medium because:  1. The interaction is not the main focus of the study described in the context. 2. The nature and details of the interaction are not elaborated upon in the given text. 3. The study mainly focuses on a mutation in synphilin-1 and its effects, rather than on the interaction between synphilin-1 and parkin.  While the interaction is clearly stated, more detailed information about the nature and implications of this interaction would be needed for a high confidence assessment.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between ATF3 protein and DNMT1 protein. The passage mentions that both ATF3 and DNMT1 were upregulated following genistein treatment in HCC1395 breast cancer cells, and that both are associated with inhibiting invasion and metastasis. However, the text does not indicate any direct interaction or relationship between these two proteins.  The information provided only suggests that both proteins are affected similarly by genistein treatment and have similar functional outcomes in terms of inhibiting cancer invasion and metastasis. Without further information about how these proteins might work together or influence each other's activity, we cannot conclude that they interact.  The confidence is low because while there's no evidence of interaction, the limited scope of the information provided doesn't completely rule out the possibility of an interaction that wasn't mentioned or studied in this particular research.
259340 2A2459395 2A2748680	parafibromin	parathyroid hormone	[INST]Context: [PMID: 23093699 MEN1 intragenic deletions may represent the most prevalent somatic event in sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism. OBJECTIVE: Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterised by an inappropriate over production of parathyroid hormone and it is the most frequent pathological condition of the parathyroid glands. The genetic alterations underlying the sporadic forms of primary hyperparathyroidism remain poorly understood. DESIGN AND METHODS: We have studied matched blood and tumour from 24 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, who went to a medical appointment in Hospital Pedro Hispano. The MEN1, RET and CDKN1B molecular study was carried out in the germline DNA by PCR/SSCP and direct sequencing. Parathyroid tumours were further analysed by the same methods for MEN1, CDKN1B and CTNNB1 genetic alterations. The multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification technique enabled the evaluation of MEN1 gene deletions. Protein expression for menin, cyclin D1, parafibromin, p27(Kip1), beta-catenin and Ki-67 was conducted by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The study of parathyroid tumours detected two somatic MEN1 mutations (c.249_252delGTCT and c.115_163del49bp) and revealed the presence of MEN1 intragenic deletions in 54% (13/24) of the tumours. In RET and CDKN1B genes only previously described, non-pathogenic variants were found. Cyclin D1 protein was overexpressed in 13% (3/24) of tumours. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MEN1 alterations, remarkably intragenic deletions, may represent the most prevalent genetic alteration in sporadic parathyroid tumours.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [parafibromin protein] and [parathyroid hormone protein] interact with each other?

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of an interaction between parafibromin protein and parathyroid hormone protein. The study focuses on genetic alterations in primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in the MEN1 gene, and mentions protein expression analysis for several proteins including parafibromin. However, parathyroid hormone protein is not specifically discussed in relation to parafibromin or any other protein interactions.  The context does mention that primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by inappropriate overproduction of parathyroid hormone, but it doesn't provide any information about how this hormone might interact with parafibromin or other proteins.  Given the lack of specific information about these two proteins interacting, I cannot confidently state that they do or do not interact based solely on this context. Therefore, I have responded with "NO" but with low confidence, as the absence of evidence in this particular study does not necessarily mean there is no interaction between these proteins in general.
235015 2A2498455 2A2509801	CAK	Cdc2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 16191191 BACKGROUND: Normal cell cycle progression requires the precise activation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent protein kinases, which consist of a CDK and a cyclin subunit. A novel cell cycle regulator called Speedy/Ringo shows no sequence similarity to cyclins, yet can directly bind to and activate cyclin-dependent protein kinases. Speedy/Ringo proteins, which bind to and activate Cdc2 and Cdk2 in vitro, are required for the G2 to M transition during Xenopus oocyte maturation and for normal S-phase entry in cultured human cells. RESULTS: We have characterized the substrate specificity and enzymatic activity of human Cdk2-Speedy/Ringo A2 in order to gain insights into the possible functions of this complex. In contrast to Cdk2-cyclin A, which has a well-defined consensus target site ((S/T)PX(K/R)) that strongly favors substrates containing a lysine at the +3 position of substrates, Cdk2-Speedy/Ringo A2 displayed a broad substrate specificity at this position. Consequently, Cdk2-Ringo/Speedy A2 phosphorylated optimal Cdk2 substrates such as histone H1 and a KSPRK peptide poorly, only approximately 0.08% as well as Cdk2-cyclin A, but non-canonical Cdk2 substrates such as a KSPRY peptide relatively well, with an efficiency of approximately 80% compared to Cdk2-cyclin A. Cdk2-Speedy/Ringo A2 also phosphorylated authentic Cdk2 substrates, such as Cdc25 proteins, which contain non-canonical CDK phosphorylation sites, nearly as well as Cdk2-cyclin A. Phosphopeptide mapping indicated that Cdk2-Speedy/Ringo A2 and Cdk2-cyclin A phosphorylate distinct subsets of sites on Cdc25 proteins. Thus, the low activity that Cdk2-Speedy/Ringo A2 displays when assayed on conventional Cdk2 substrates may significantly underestimate the potential physiological importance of Cdk2-Speedy/Ringo A2 in phosphorylating key subsets of Cdk2 substrates. Unlike Cdk2-cyclin A, whose activity depends strongly on activating phosphorylation of Cdk2 on Thr-160, neither the overall catalytic activity nor the substrate recognition by Cdk2-Speedy/Ringo A2 was significantly affected by this phosphorylation. Furthermore, Cdk2-Speedy/Ringo A2 was not a suitable substrate for metazoan CAK (which phosphorylates Cdk2 at Thr-160), supporting the notion that Speedy/Ringo A2 activates Cdk2 in a CAK-independent manner. These differences may accommodate the CAK-independent activation of Cdk2 by Speedy/Ringo A2 and they raise the possibility that CDK-Speedy/Ringo A2 complexes could phosphorylate and regulate a subset of non-canonical CDK substrates, such as Cdc25 protein phosphatases, to control cell cycle progression.

If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone."

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between CAK protein and Cdc2 protein. The passage mentions both proteins, but it does not describe any direct interaction or relationship between them.   The context discusses: 1. Cdc2 as a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that can be activated by Speedy/Ringo proteins. 2. CAK (Cyclin-Activating Kinase) as an enzyme that phosphorylates Cdk2 at Thr-160.  However, the text does not mention any direct interaction or functional relationship between CAK and Cdc2. Instead, it focuses on the differences between Cdk2-Speedy/Ringo A2 and Cdk2-cyclin A complexes, particularly in terms of their substrate specificity and dependence on CAK-mediated phosphorylation.  The medium confidence level is assigned because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, it's possible that these proteins could interact in ways not mentioned in this specific passage, given their roles in cell cycle regulation.

In humans, cohesin is a ubiquitously expressed, multi-subunit protein complex composed of core subunits SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, STAG1/2 and regulatory subunits WAPL, PDS5A/B, CDCA5, NIPBL, and MAU2. Recent studies have demonstrated that genes encoding cohesin subunits are somatically mutated in a wide range of human cancers. STAG2 is the most commonly mutated subunit, and in a recent analysis was identified as one of only 12 genes that are significantly mutated in four or more cancer types. In this review we summarize the findings reported to date and comment on potential functional implications of cohesin mutation in the pathogenesis of human cancer.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [NIPBL protein] and [CDCA5 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, NIPBL and CDCA5 proteins are likely to interact with each other, although their direct interaction is not explicitly stated. Here's why:  1. Both NIPBL and CDCA5 are mentioned as regulatory subunits of the cohesin complex.  2. The context states that cohesin is a "multi-subunit protein complex" composed of core subunits and regulatory subunits, which includes both NIPBL and CDCA5.  3. As part of the same protein complex, it is reasonable to assume that these subunits interact with each other to some degree, either directly or indirectly, to perform the complex's functions.  4. The cohesin complex is described as playing important roles in various cellular processes, which suggests that its subunits work together.  However, the confidence level is medium because:  1. The context does not explicitly state a direct interaction between NIPBL and CDCA5.  2. The nature and extent of their interaction within the cohesin complex is not specified.  3. Without more specific information about how these regulatory subunits function within the complex, we cannot be certain about the exact nature of their interaction.  Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that NIPBL and CDCA5 proteins likely interact as part of the cohesin complex, but the specifics of this interaction are not provided in the given context.
492184 2A2889302 2A2649179	SYT	monoacylglycerol lipase	[INST]Context: [PMID: 33049367 Cannabinoid receptor subtype influence on neuritogenesis in human SH-SY5Y cells. Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably expressing exogenous CB1 (CB1XS) or CB2 (CB2XS) receptors were developed to investigate endocannabinoid signaling in the extension of neuronal projections. Expression of cannabinoid receptors did not alter proliferation rate, viability, or apoptosis relative to parental SH-SY5Y. Transcripts for endogenous cannabinoid system enzymes (diacylglycerol lipase, monoacylglycerol lipase, alpha/beta-hydrolase domain containing proteins 6 and 12, N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-phospholipase D, and fatty acid amide hydrolase) were not altered by CB1 or CB2 expression. Endocannabinoid ligands 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide were quantitated in SH-SY5Y cells, and diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin decreased 2-arachidonoylglycerol abundance by 90% but did not alter anandamide abundance. M3 muscarinic agonist oxotremorine M, and inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase and alpha/beta hydrolase domain containing proteins 6 &12 increased 2-arachidonoylglycerol abundance. CB1 receptor expression increased lengths of short (<30 mum) and long (>30 mum) projections, and this effect was significantly reduced by tetrahydrolipstatin, indicative of stimulation by endogenously produced 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Pertussis toxin, Gbetagamma inhibitor gallein, and beta-arrestin inhibitor barbadin did not significantly alter long projection length in CB1XS, but significantly reduced short projections, with gallein having the greatest inhibition. The rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 increased CB1 receptor-mediated long projection extension, indicative of actin cytoskeleton involvement. CB1 receptor expression increased GAP43 and ST8SIA2 mRNA and decreased ITGA1 mRNA, whereas CB2 receptor expression increased NCAM and SYT mRNA. We propose that basal endogenous production of 2-arachidonoylglycerol provides autocrine stimulation of CB1 receptor signaling through Gi/o, Gbetagamma, and beta-arrestin mechanisms to promote neuritogenesis, and rho kinase influences process extension.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SYT protein] and [monoacylglycerol lipase protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence  Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of an interaction between SYT protein and monoacylglycerol lipase protein. The context discusses various aspects of cannabinoid receptor signaling and its effects on neuritogenesis, but it does not directly address any relationship between these two specific proteins.  The context mentions that CB2 receptor expression increased SYT mRNA, and that inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase increased 2-arachidonoylglycerol abundance. However, these are separate observations and do not indicate a direct interaction between the two proteins.  Given the limited information provided about these specific proteins in the context, we cannot confidently state that they interact. However, it's important to note that the absence of evidence for interaction in this specific context does not necessarily mean that these proteins do not interact in other cellular processes or under different conditions.
305443 2A2459929 2A2459951	p21CIP1	p15INK4B	[INST]Context: [PMID: 9875645 Immediate onset of DNA synthesis in remnant rat liver after 90% hepatectomy by an administration of follistatin. BACKGROUND/AIM: Follistatin is an antagonist of activins and is effective in promoting liver regeneration after 70% hepatectomy. To examine its efficacy under more critical conditions, we studied the effect of follistatin on liver regeneration in 90% hepatectomized rat. METHODS: Human recombinant follistatin was infused into the portal vein immediately after 90%, hepatectomy in 24-h-starved rats, and changes in the liver regeneration rate and nuclear bromodeoxyuridine labeling were measured. RESULTS: In control rats, nuclear labeling was first detected at 11 h of hepatectomy. In follistatin-treated rats, nuclear labeling was markedly increased at 3 h, and was significantly higher than that in control rats at 24, 72, 96, 120 and 144 h. The liver regeneration rate was significantly higher in follistatin-treated rats at 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 h. To determine the reason for the accelerated growth in starved rats, we compared the expression of mRNA for c-myc, p53, p21CIP1, p15INK4B, p27KIP1, and subunits of activins in fed and starved rats. MRNA for p21CIP1 and p15INK4B, but not p27KIP1 were decreased in 24 h-starved rats compared to the fed rats. MRNA for betaA subunit of activin was not detected in either fed or 24-h-starved rats, whereas that for betaC subunit was increased in starved rats. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that follistatin induces immediate onset of DNA synthesis in 90% hepatectomized rats and is quite effective in promoting liver regeneration.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of interaction between p21CIP1 protein and p15INK4B protein. The study describes changes in mRNA expression levels for these proteins in starved rats compared to fed rats, but it does not indicate any direct interaction between them.   The text states: "MRNA for p21CIP1 and p15INK4B, but not p27KIP1 were decreased in 24 h-starved rats compared to the fed rats." This suggests that both p21CIP1 and p15INK4B are affected similarly by starvation, but it does not imply that they interact with each other.  The study focuses on the effects of follistatin on liver regeneration and DNA synthesis, and while it mentions these proteins, it does not describe any functional or physical interaction between p21CIP1 and p15INK4B. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that these proteins interact with each other.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction in the provided context, the study does not exhaustively explore all possible protein interactions, leaving room for uncertainty.

Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between CD58 protein and FLI1 protein. The study focuses on gene expression changes in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment in HL-60 cells, and while both CD58 and FLI1 are mentioned, they are listed among other genes with altered expression at different time points.  CD58 is reported as downregulated at 24 hours, while FLI1 is listed as downregulated at both 24 and 72 hours. However, the context does not provide any information about a direct interaction or relationship between these two proteins.  The low confidence is due to the limited information provided about these specific proteins and the focus of the study being on overall gene expression changes rather than protein-protein interactions.

703289 2A2456072 2A2877579	CBX4	SUV39H2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 32979540 Biological functions of chromobox proteins in stem cell self-renewal, lineage-commitment, cancer and development. Epigenetic regulatory proteins support mammalian development, cancer, aging and tissue repair by controlling many cellular processes including stem cell self-renewal, lineage-commitment and senescence in both skeletal and non-skeletal tissues. We review here our knowledge of epigenetic regulatory protein complexes that support the formation of inaccessible heterochromatin and suppress expression of cell and tissue-type specific biomarkers during development. Maintenance and formation of heterochromatin critically depends on epigenetic regulators that recognize histone 3 lysine trimethylation at residues K9 and K27 (respectively, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3), which represent transcriptionally suppressive epigenetic marks. Three chromobox proteins (i.e., CBX1, CBX3 or CBX5) associated with the heterochromatin protein 1 complex are methyl readers that interpret H3K9me3 marks which are mediated by H3K9 methyltransferases (i.e., SUV39H1 or SUV39H2). Other chromobox proteins (i.e., CBX2, CBX4, CBX6, CBX7 and CBX8) recognize H3K27me3, which is deposited by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2; a complex containing SUZ12, EED, RBAP46/48 and the methyl transferases EZH1 or EZH2). This second set of chromobox proteins resides in PRC1, which has many subunits including other polycomb group factors (PCGF1, PCGF2, PCGF3, PCGF4, PCGF5, PCGF6), human polyhomeotic homologs (HPH1, HPH2, HPH3) and E3-ubiquitin ligases (RING1 or RING2). The latter enzymes catalyze the subsequent mono-ubiquitination of lysine 119 in H2A (H2AK119ub). We discuss biological, cellular and molecular functions of chromobox proteins and their physiological and pathological activities in non-skeletal cells and tissues in anticipation of new discoveries on novel roles for chromobox proteins in bone formation and skeletal development.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CBX4 protein] and [SUV39H2 protein] interact with each other?

Based on the provided context, there is no direct interaction mentioned between CBX4 protein and SUV39H2 protein. The text describes these proteins as being part of different complexes and recognizing different histone modifications:  1. CBX4 is mentioned as one of the chromobox proteins (CBX2, CBX4, CBX6, CBX7, and CBX8) that recognizes H3K27me3 and is associated with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1).  2. SUV39H2 is mentioned as one of the H3K9 methyltransferases (along with SUV39H1) that mediate the H3K9me3 mark.  These proteins are involved in different epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and are not described as directly interacting with each other. However, since both are involved in epigenetic regulation and chromatin modification, there might be indirect relationships or cross-talk between their pathways that are not explicitly mentioned in this context. This is why I've assigned a medium confidence level to this assessment.

BACKGROUND: The well-known characteristics of aging skin are the development of fine lines and wrinkles, but changes in skin tone, skin texture, thickness and moisture content are also aspects of aging. Rejuvenation of the skin aims at reversing the signs of aging and can be established in the epidermis as well as in the dermis. To regenerate this matrix, fibroblasts need to be stimulated into synthesizing new collagen. AIMS: In this study, the effects of heat shocks of different temperatures on human dermal fibroblasts in ex vivo skin on the expression of procollagen 1, procollagen 3, heat shock protein 27, hsp47, and hsp70 are investigated. Furthermore, PicroSirius Red and hematoxylin stainings were performed to visualize the collagen network and the cells. Histology indicated that the heat shocks did not influence the structure of the collagen network or cell appearance. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed that in contrast to the 45 oC heat shock the 60 oC heat shock resulted in significant upregulations of procollagen type I and III, hsp70 and hsp47. CONCLUSION: A 60 oC, heat shock stimulates the human dermal fibroblasts in ex vivo skin to upregulate their procollagen type I and type III expression.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [hsp70 protein] and [hsp47 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence to suggest that hsp70 and hsp47 proteins are interacting in a similar way, although the interaction is not explicitly stated. Here's why:  1. Both hsp70 and hsp47 are mentioned together as being upregulated in response to the same stimulus (60°C heat shock).  2. They are both heat shock proteins (HSPs), which typically work together in cellular stress responses.  3. The context mentions that both proteins were significantly upregulated along with procollagen type I and III in response to the 60°C heat shock, suggesting they may be part of the same cellular response mechanism.  4. Hsp47 is known to be a collagen-specific molecular chaperone, while Hsp70 is a more general molecular chaperone. Their simultaneous upregulation in this context suggests they might be working together in the cellular response to heat stress and in the production of collagen.  While the interaction between hsp70 and hsp47 is not explicitly stated, their co-occurrence and similar response to the heat shock treatment suggest a functional relationship. However, without more direct evidence of their interaction, we cannot be absolutely certain, hence the medium confidence level.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between PRKCSH protein and TRIM28 protein. Both proteins are mentioned in the text, but they are listed separately as part of different groups of genes related to prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma:  "While low-expressed LDHB, ARID2, PRKCSH, HDAC4, NIPA1, RABAC1, TRIM28 and high-expressed FAM160B1, DNAAF3, CCNT1, ADAP1, ZFPM1, CCL11 were related with good prognosis."  PRKCSH and TRIM28 are both listed as low-expressed genes associated with good prognosis, but there is no indication of a direct interaction between them. The context does not provide any information about how these proteins might functionally relate to each other or interact in any biological process.  The low confidence level is assigned because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, the possibility of an interaction cannot be completely ruled out based solely on this limited information. Further research would be needed to definitively determine whether these proteins interact or not.

A systematic proteomics approach revealed that sclerostin (SOST), growth differentiation factor-15, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and midkine were increased, while monocyte chemotactic protein-3 was uniquely decreased in myocardial infarction patients who developed cardiac remodelling, compared to myocardial infarction patients who did not develop cardiac remodelling and healthy humen. Moreover, correlation analyses between serum proteomes and cardiac remodelling echocardiographic parameters demonstrated a moderate positive association between left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and the three serum proteins, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, midkine and growth differentiation factor-15 (P < .05, respectively), and a moderate negative correlation between LV ejection fraction and these serum proteins (P < .05, respectively). Importantly, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and midkine were firstly identified to be associated with the development of cardiac remodelling. The identified biomarkers may facilitate early identification of patients at high risk of ischaemic heart failure pending further confirmation through larger clinical trials.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [midkine protein] and [monocyte chemotactic protein-3 protein] interact with each other?

If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone."

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no evidence of direct interaction between midkine protein and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 protein. The text mentions these proteins separately in different contexts:  1. Midkine is reported to be increased in myocardial infarction patients who developed cardiac remodelling.  2. Monocyte chemotactic protein-3 is reported to be uniquely decreased in the same group of patients.  While both proteins are mentioned as potential biomarkers for cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction, there is no information suggesting they interact with each other or have any combined effects. They appear to be independent markers that change in opposite directions (increase vs. decrease) in the context of cardiac remodelling.  The confidence is medium because while there is no indication of interaction, the text does not explicitly state that these proteins do not interact. It's possible that there could be some unknown relationship between them that is not mentioned in this specific context.

There has been a spectacular rise in the global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of cardiac muscle genes that are involved in the process of excitation-contraction coupling in the hearts of early onset (8-10 weeks of age) type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats. Shortening and intracellular Ca(2+) were measured in ventricular myocytes with video edge detection and fluorescence photometry, respectively. The general characteristics of the goto-kakizaki rats included elevated fasting and non-fasting blood glucose and blood glucose at 120 min following a glucose challenge. Expression of genes encoding cardiac muscle proteins (Myh6/7, Mybpc3, Myl1/3, Actc1, Tnni3, Tnn2, Tpm1/2/4 and Dbi) and intercellular proteins (Gja1/4/5/7, Dsp and Cav1/3) were unaltered in goto-kakizaki ventricle compared with control ventricle. The expression of genes encoding some membrane pumps and exchange proteins was unaltered (Atp1a1/2, Atp1b1 and Slc8a1), whilst others were either upregulated (Atp1a3, relative expression 2.61 +- 0.69 versus 0.84 +- 0.23) or downregulated (Slc9a1, 0.62 +- 0.07 versus 1.08 +- 0.08) in goto-kakizaki ventricle compared with control ventricle. The expression of genes encoding some calcium (Cacna1c/1g, Cacna2d1/2d2 and Cacnb1/b2), sodium and potassium channels (Kcna3/5, Kcnj3/5/8/11/12, Kchip2, Kcnab1, Kcnb1, Kcnd1/2/3, Kcne1/4, Kcnq1, Kcng2, Kcnh2, Kcnk3 and Kcnn2) were unaltered, whilst others were either upregulated (Cacna1h, 0.95 +- 0.16 versus 0.47 +- 0.09; Scn1b, 1.84 +- 0.16 versus 1.11 +- 0.11; and Hcn2, 1.55 +- 0.15 versus 1.03 +- 0.08) or downregulated (Hcn4, 0.16 +- 0.03 versus 0.37 +- 0.08; Kcna2, 0.35 +- 0.03 versus 0.80 +- 0.11; Kcna4, 0.79 +- 0.25 versus 1.90 +- 0.26; and Kcnj2, 0.52 +- 0.07 versus 0.78 +- 0.08) in goto-kakizaki ventricle compared with control ventricle. The amplitude of ventricular myocyte shortening and the intracellular Ca(2+) transient were unaltered; However, the time-to-peak shortening was prolonged and time-to-half decay of the Ca(2+) transient was shortened in goto-kakizaki myocytes compared with control myocytes. The results of this study demonstrate changes in expression of genes encoding various excitation-contraction coupling proteins that are associated with disturbances in myocyte shortening and intracellular Ca(2+) transport.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct indication of interaction between Kcna4 protein and Kcnh2 protein. The study mentions both proteins, but they are discussed separately in the context of gene expression changes in diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats compared to control rats.  Specifically: 1. Kcna4 gene expression is reported to be downregulated in Goto-Kakizaki ventricle compared to control ventricle (0.79 +- 0.25 versus 1.90 +- 0.26). 2. Kcnh2 gene expression is reported to be unaltered in Goto-Kakizaki ventricle compared to control ventricle.  These proteins are both potassium channels, but the study does not describe any functional interaction or relationship between them. They are simply listed among other ion channel genes whose expression was examined in this study. Without further information suggesting a direct interaction or relationship between these two proteins, we cannot conclude that they interact with each other in the context of this study.  The confidence is medium because while there's no evidence of interaction, the study doesn't explicitly state that these proteins don't interact, and there could potentially be undescribed interactions in cardiac function that are not covered in this specific research context.
618672 2A2613339 2A2984829	ERG1	ZEB2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34499269 EGR1-CCL2 Feedback Loop Maintains Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Cisplatin-Resistant Gastric Cancer Cells and Promotes Tumor Angiogenesis. BACKGROUND: The mechanism of cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer is still elusive; Several recent evidences proposed that chemoresistant tumor cells acquired aggressive behaviors. AIMS: This study was aimed to investigate the mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in chemoresistant gastric cancer. RESULTS: Compared with the parental cell line SGC7901, cisplatin resistant SGC7901R cells underwent epithelial-mesenchymal transition and showed increased angiogenic capabilities. Mechanistically, SGC7901R cells showed increased levels of EGR1, which could transcriptionally activate the angiogenic factor CCL2 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulator ZEB2. Reciprocally, CCL2 activated the CCR2-ERK-ELK1-EGR1 pathway, thus forming a positive feed-forward loop. Moreover, CCL2 in culture medium of SGC7901R cells promoted angiogenesis of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells . EGR1 expression was positively correlated with CCL2 and ZEB2 in clinical gastric cancer tissues, and the depletion of ERG1 could also decrease microvessel density and ZEB2 expression in metastatic nodules of nude mice. CONCLUSIONS: EGR1-CCL2 feedback loop might exert critical roles on epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis of chemoresistant gastric cancer.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [ERG1 protein] and [ZEB2 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.  Based on the provided context, there is evidence suggesting an interaction between ERG1 (likely a typo for EGR1) and ZEB2 proteins. The following points support this interaction:  1. The study mentions that EGR1 can transcriptionally activate ZEB2, which is described as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulator.  2. EGR1 expression is positively correlated with ZEB2 in clinical gastric cancer tissues.  3. The depletion of EGR1 (referred to as ERG1 in the question, likely a typo) decreased ZEB2 expression in metastatic nodules of nude mice.  These points suggest that EGR1 has a regulatory effect on ZEB2, indicating an interaction between the two proteins. However, the confidence level is medium because:  1. The interaction is not explicitly described as direct. 2. The study focuses more on the EGR1-CCL2 feedback loop, with ZEB2 being a secondary player in the mechanism. 3. There might be other intermediary factors involved in the regulation of ZEB2 by EGR1 that are not mentioned in the given context.  Given these considerations, we can conclude that there is evidence for an interaction between EGR1 (ERG1) and ZEB2 proteins, but with medium confidence due to the indirect nature of the described relationship and the potential for other factors to be involved.
364000 2A2866725 2A2516455	Sod2	Endothelin-1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 27465439 Endothelin-1 Overexpression Exaggerates Diabetes-Induced Endothelial Dysfunction by Altering Oxidative Stress. BACKGROUND: Increased endothelin -1 expression causes endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Plasma ET-1 is increased in patients with diabetes mellitus. Since endothelial dysfunction often precedes vascular complications in diabetes, we hypothesized that overexpression of ET-1 in the endothelium would exaggerate diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction. METHODS: Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin treatment (55mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 5 days in 6-week-old male wild type mice and in mice overexpressing human ET-1 restricted to the endothelium (eET-1). Mice were studied 14 weeks later. Small mesenteric artery endothelial function and vascular remodeling by pressurized myography, reactive oxygen species production by dihydroethidium staining and mRNA expression by reverse transcription/quantitative PCR were determined. RESULTS: Endothelium-dependent vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine of mesenteric artery were reduced 24% by diabetes in wild type ( P < 0.05), and further decreased by 12% in eET-1 ( P < 0.05). Diabetes decreased mesenteric artery media/lumen in wild type and eET-1 ( P < 0.05), whereas ET-1 overexpression increased mesenteric artery media/lumen similarly in diabetic and nondiabetic wild type mice ( P < 0.05). Vascular reactive oxygen species production was increased 2-fold by diabetes in wild type ( P < 0.05) and further augmented 1.7-fold in eET-1 ( P < 0.05). Diabetes reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, Nos3 ) expression in eET-1 by 31% ( P < 0.05) but not in wild type. Induction of diabetes caused a 52% ( P < 0.05) increase in superoxide dismutase 1 ( superoxide dismutase 1 ) and a 32% ( P < 0.05) increase in Sod2 expression in wild type but not in eET-1. CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of ET-1 exaggerates diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction. This may be caused by decrease in eNOS expression, increase in vascular oxidative stress, and decrease in antioxidant capacity.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between Sod2 protein and Endothelin-1 protein. The study focuses on the effects of Endothelin-1 overexpression on diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and related factors. While Sod2 (superoxide dismutase 2) is mentioned in the context, it is not described as directly interacting with Endothelin-1.  The study reports that diabetes caused an increase in Sod2 expression in wild-type mice, but not in mice overexpressing Endothelin-1 (eET-1). This suggests that Endothelin-1 overexpression may influence Sod2 expression in diabetic conditions, but it does not necessarily imply a direct protein-protein interaction between Sod2 and Endothelin-1.  The medium confidence level is assigned because while there is no explicit mention of interaction between these two proteins, their expressions are affected in the context of diabetes and Endothelin-1 overexpression, suggesting a potential indirect relationship. However, more direct evidence would be needed to confirm any interaction between these two proteins.
574510 2A2734750 2A2525541	PPARA	EP300	[INST]Context: [PMID: 32562712 Developmental programming: Prenatal testosterone-induced changes in epigenetic modulators and gene expression in metabolic tissues of female sheep. Prenatal testosterone (T)-treated female sheep manifest peripheral insulin resistance and tissue-specific changes in insulin sensitivity with liver and muscle manifesting insulin resistance accompanied by inflammatory, oxidative and lipotoxic state. In contrast, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues are insulin sensitive in spite of visceral manifesting changes in inflammatory and oxidative state. We hypothesized that prenatal T-induced changes in tissue-specific insulin resistance arise from disrupted lipid storage and metabolism gene expression driven by changes in DNA and histone modifying enzymes. Changes in gene expression were assessed in liver, muscle and 4 adipose (VAT, subcutaneous, epicardiac and perirenal ) depots collected from control and prenatal T-treated female sheep. Prenatal T-treatment increased lipid droplet and metabolism genes PPARA and PLIN1 in liver, SREBF and PLIN1 in muscle and showed a trend for decrease in PLIN2 in perirenal. Among epigenetic modifying enzymes, prenatal T-treatment increased expression of 1) DNMT1 in liver and DNMT3A in visceral, perirenal, muscle and liver; 2) HDAC1 in epicardiac, HDAC2 in muscle with decrease in HDAC3 in visceral; 3) EP300 in visceral and epicardiac; And 4) KDM1A in visceral with increases in liver histone acetylation. Increased lipid storage and metabolism genes in liver and muscle are consistent with lipotoxicity in these tissues with increased histone acetylation likely contributing to increased liver PPARA. These findings are suggestive that metabolic defects in prenatal T-treated sheep may arise from changes in key genes mediated, in part, by tissue-specific changes in epigenetic-modifying enzymes.

Explanation: The provided context does not explicitly mention any direct interaction between PPARA protein and EP300 protein. While both proteins are mentioned in the text, they are discussed in different contexts and tissues:  1. PPARA is mentioned as being increased in the liver of prenatal testosterone-treated female sheep. 2. EP300 is reported to have increased expression in visceral and epicardiac adipose tissues.  The text focuses on tissue-specific changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifying enzymes in response to prenatal testosterone treatment. It does not describe any functional or regulatory relationship between PPARA and EP300.  However, it's worth noting that in other contexts not mentioned in this specific study, PPARA and EP300 are known to have some functional relationships in gene regulation and metabolism. EP300 is a histone acetyltransferase that can act as a coactivator for various transcription factors, including PPARA. But since this interaction is not mentioned or implied in the given context, we cannot conclude that they interact based solely on the information provided.  The confidence level is medium because while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, the possibility of a broader biological relationship between these proteins cannot be entirely ruled out based on this limited information.

DESIGN: Hybridization capture of 3769 exons from 236 cancer-related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes commonly rearranged in cancer was applied to a minimum of 50 ng of DNA extracted from 20 metaplastic breast carcinoma formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens and sequenced to high uniform coverage. RESULTS: The 20 patients with metaplastic breast carcinoma had a median age of 62 years (range, 42-86 years). The most-common alterations were in TP53 (n = 69; 75%), PIK3CA (n = 37; 40%), MYC (n = 28; 30%), MLL2 (n = 28; 30%), PTEN (n = 23; 25%), CDKN2A/B (n = 19; 20%), CCND3 (n = 14; 15%), CCNE1 (n = 9; 10%), EGFR (n = 9; 10%), and KDM6A (n = 9; 10%); AKT3, CCND1, CCND2, CDK4, FBXW7, FGFR1, HRAS, NF1, PIK3R1, and SRC were each altered in a single case.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence  Based on the provided context, there is no clear evidence of interaction between CDK4 protein and SRC protein. The information given only mentions that CDK4 and SRC were each altered in a single case among the 20 metaplastic breast carcinoma specimens studied. There is no description of any functional or physical interaction between these two proteins.  The low confidence is due to the limited information provided about these specific proteins in the context.

Genetically modified mice provide a number of models for studying cardiac channelopathies related to cardiac Na(+) channel (SCN5A) abnormalities. We review key pathophysiological features in these murine models that may underlie clinical features observed in sinus node dysfunction and progressive cardiac conduction disease, thereby providing insights into their pathophysiological mechanisms. Recent reports further relate the progressive fibrotic changes to upregulation of TGF-beta1 production and the transcription factors, Atf3, a stress-inducible gene, and Egr1, to the presence of heterozygous Scn5a gene deletion. Murine systems with genetic modifications in Scn5a thus prove a useful tool to address questions concerning roles of genetic and environmental modifiers on human SCN5A disease phenotypes.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Atf3 protein] and [Scn5a protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: The context suggests an indirect interaction between Atf3 protein and Scn5a protein, although it's not explicitly stated that they directly interact. The passage mentions that "Recent reports further relate the progressive fibrotic changes to upregulation of TGF-beta1 production and the transcription factors, Atf3, a stress-inducible gene, and Egr1, to the presence of heterozygous Scn5a gene deletion."  This statement implies that there is a relationship between Atf3 and Scn5a, where the deletion of Scn5a leads to changes in Atf3 expression. While this is not a direct physical interaction, it does indicate a functional relationship or interaction in the broader sense of the term.  The confidence level is medium because: 1. The interaction is implied rather than explicitly stated. 2. The nature of the interaction is not fully detailed. 3. It's not clear if this is a direct or indirect interaction.  However, the context does provide evidence of a connection between these two proteins in the pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction associated with SCN5A deficiency, which supports the existence of some form of interaction.

OBJECTIVE: To define the potential causative gene mutation in a Chinese pedigree with progressive cardiac conduction defect . METHODS: Sanger sequencing was performed to define potential causative gene mutation in a four-generation family with 68 members including seven progressive cardiac conduction defect patients (5 male) from 2010 to 2015.No causative gene was detected by screening known candidate genes related to progressive cardiac conduction defect including SCN5A, NKX2.5 and LMNA.High-throughput sequencing technology on exon-enriched DNA was then used to search the causative genes in 2 patients and one normal family member. RESULTS: Eight new non-synonymous single nucleotide variants including AQP7 gene (exon5: c.T343C: p.Y115H), CACNA1B gene (NM_001243812: exon19: c.A2986G: p.T996A), CATSPERB gene (exon27: c.C3254G: p.P1085R), CLCA2 gene (exon11: c.G1725T: p.W575C), CLCA3P gene (ncRNA_intronic), MYLK-AS1 gene (ncRNA_intronic), TTN gene (ncRNA_UTR3), LMNA gene (LMNA: NM_170708: exon5: c.C922T: p.Q308X) were identified by comparing and filtering the results with known public databases.Then, more detailed biological analysis on these 8 genes was conducted.Traditional Sanger sequencing validated the exome sequencing results, and found that the mutation c. 1725Gi__T in gene CLCA2 segregated with the phenotype of this progressive cardiac conduction defect pedigree.The mutation c. 1725Gi__T in gene CLCA2 was thus be considered as the causative progressive cardiac conduction defect gene in this pedigree from the perspective of genetics and genomics. 1725Gi__T in gene CLCA2 might be causative gene in this progressive cardiac conduction defect pedigree.This finding adds new gene mutation variant responsible for progressive cardiac conduction defect.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SCN5A protein] and [LMNA protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence  Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between SCN5A protein and LMNA protein. The passage mentions both SCN5A and LMNA as known candidate genes related to progressive cardiac conduction defect, but it does not describe any interaction between their protein products.   The text states that no causative gene was detected by screening known candidate genes, including SCN5A and LMNA, which suggests these genes were investigated separately rather than in interaction with each other. Later, a mutation in the LMNA gene was identified through high-throughput sequencing, but again, no interaction with SCN5A is mentioned.  Given the lack of explicit information about interaction between these proteins and the focus of the study on identifying a novel causative gene mutation (which turned out to be in CLCA2), I have low confidence in stating that these proteins do not interact. It's possible they do interact in ways not mentioned in this specific context, but based solely on the information provided, there is no evidence of interaction.

Here we report that the SAE2 subunit of human SUMO activation enzyme underwent rapid nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and its nuclear accumulation depended on SUMO modification at the C terminus. The SUMOylation sites included three Lys residues on the bipartite nuclear localization sequence and two Lys residues outside of but adjacent to the nuclear localization sequence, and their SUMOylation was catalyzed by Ubc9. Because SAE2 forms a tight heterodimer with SAE1 and it controls the trafficking of the heterodimer, this study has identified the mechanism used to localize sumo activation enzyme to the nucleus. Similar mechanisms are likely to exist for other proteins that depend on SUMOylation for nuclear localization.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SAE2 protein] and [Ubc9 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Based on the provided context, the SAE2 protein and Ubc9 protein do interact with each other. The passage states that "SUMOylation was catalyzed by Ubc9" when referring to the SUMOylation of specific lysine residues on the SAE2 protein. This clearly indicates a direct enzymatic interaction between Ubc9 (the enzyme) and SAE2 (the substrate).  The interaction is described in a functional context, where Ubc9 is performing a specific enzymatic action (SUMOylation) on SAE2. This type of enzyme-substrate interaction is a clear example of protein-protein interaction, similar to the interacting example provided in the instructions.  The confidence is high because the interaction is explicitly stated and described in terms of a specific biochemical process (SUMOylation), leaving little room for ambiguity about the nature of the interaction between these two proteins.

The rabbit has been extensively utilized as an ideal model of atherosclerosis because of its size, easy manipulation, and extraordinary response to dietary cholesterol. The availability of spontaneously hypercholesterolemic model, Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits (WHHL) and St. Thomas rabbits, has also provided insights into understanding human familiar hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. With the advent of genetically engineered rabbits, transgenic rabbits have become a novel means to explore a number of proteins that are associated with cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis. To date, transgenes for human apo(a), apoA-I, apoB, apoE2, apoE3, hepatic lipase, lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), lipoprotein lipase, 15-lipoxygenase, as well as for rabbit apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC-1), have been expressed in rabbits. In addition, human apoA-I, LCAT and apo(a) have been introduced into WHHL rabbits which have deficient LDL receptor function. All of these transgenes have been found to have significant effects on plasma lipoprotein metabolism or/and atherosclerosis. These studies have revealed new insights into the mechanisms responsible for the development of atherosclerosis.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a direct interaction between apoA-I protein and lipoprotein lipase protein. The passage lists these proteins among others that have been expressed in transgenic rabbits for the study of atherosclerosis, but it does not describe any specific interaction between them.  The text states: "To date, transgenes for human apo(a), apoA-I, apoB, apoE2, apoE3, hepatic lipase, lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), lipoprotein lipase, 15-lipoxygenase, as well as for rabbit apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC-1), have been expressed in rabbits."  While both apoA-I and lipoprotein lipase are mentioned in this list, they are presented as separate proteins that have been studied in transgenic rabbit models. The passage does not provide any information about how these proteins might interact with each other in the context of lipoprotein metabolism or atherosclerosis development.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, it's possible that these proteins could interact in ways not mentioned in this specific passage, given their roles in lipid metabolism.
578535 2A2459951 2A2459937	CDKN2B	CDKN1B	[INST]Context: [PMID: 32430905 Genetic testing for hereditary hyperparathyroidism and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia in a large UK cohort. BACKGROUND: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPTH) is a common endocrine disorder and an estimated 10% of cases are hereditary, related to syndromes including; Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4, MEN2A and hereditary hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumour syndrome. Establishing the underlying genetic cause for PHPTH allows for personalized and cost-effective management. Familial hypocalicuric hypercalcaemia is a benign disorder of hypercalcaemia associated with an inappropriately low urinary calcium excretion, which is quantified by the calcium creatinine clearance ratio . Recent NHS England National Genomic Test Directory testing criteria for familial hyperparathyroidism state testing patients presenting with PHPTH and CCCR > 0.02 presenting (i) <35 years of age, or (ii) <45y with one of (a) multiglandular disease, or (b) hyperplasia on histology, or (c) ossifying fibroma(s) of the maxilla and/ or mandible, or (d) a family history of unexplained PHPTH. The testing criterion for familial hypocalicuric hypercalcaemia is a CCCR < 0.02. AIMS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of patients referred for genetic testing over a 4 year period for suspected hereditary HPTH was performed. MEN1, CDC73, CASR, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, RET, GCM2, GNA11, and AP2S1 in NHS-accredited Regional Genetic laboratories. Aims of this study were to better define testing criteria for suspected hereditary PHPTH in a UK cohort. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients were included in this study (92 female) with a mean age of 41 years (SD 17). A pathogenic variant was identified in the PHPTH genes CDC73 in a single patient and MEN1 in six patients (6% of total), in the familial hypocalicuric hypercalcaemia genes, CASR in 11 patients and AP2S1 in a single paediatric case (10% of total). A variant of uncertain significance was identified in eight patients (6%) but over the course of this study familial segregation studies and computational analysis enabled re-classification of four of the variants, with two VUS's in the CASR gene being upgraded to likely pathogenic variants. A significant difference in the mean calcium creatinine clearance ratio in those patients with an identified CASR pathogenic variant versus those without (P = .0001) was demonstrated in this study. Thirty-three patients were aged over 50 years and the diagnostic rate of a pathogenic variant was 15.1% in those patients >50 years of age compared to 15.9% in those <50 years. Five patients >50 years and with a calcium creatinine clearance ratio of <0.01, were diagnosed with a pathogenic variant in CASR. CONCLUSION: Family history was the strongest predictor of hereditary PHPTH in this cohort. This study has highlighted the importance of re-evaluating VUS's in order to inform patient management and enable appropriate genetic counselling. Finally, this study has demonstrated the need to consider genetic testing for PHPTH in patients of any age, particularly those with additional risk factors.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CDKN2B protein] and [CDKN1B protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence  While the context mentions both CDKN2B and CDKN1B as genes that were tested for in the study, there is no information provided about any interaction between the proteins encoded by these genes. The text simply lists them among other genes that were tested, but does not discuss any functional relationships or interactions between them.  The low confidence is due to the limited information provided in the context.

492713 2A2872905 2A2719620	Structure-specific recognition protein-1	PH2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 29764934 Structure-specific recognition protein-1 is an elongated homodimer that binds histones. The histone chaperone complex facilitates chromatin transcription plays important roles in DNA repair, replication, and transcription. In the formation of this complex, structure-specific recognition protein-1 heterodimerizes with suppressor of Ty 16 . Structure-specific recognition protein-1 also has SPT16-independent functions, but how structure-specific recognition protein-1 functions alone remains elusive. Here, using analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering techniques, we characterized human structure-specific recognition protein-1 and that from the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and show that both orthologs form an elongated homodimer in solution. We found that substitutions in the structure-specific recognition protein-1 pleckstrin homology domain known to bind suppressor of ty 16 also disrupt structure-specific recognition protein-1 homodimerization. Moreover, analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle x-ray scattering analyses revealed that structure-specific recognition protein-1 homodimerization and heterodimerization with suppressor of ty 16 (resulting in FACT) involve the same structure-specific recognition protein-1 surface, namely the PH2 region, and that the facilitates chromatin transcription complex contains only one molecule of structure-specific recognition protein-1. These observations suggest that structure-specific recognition protein-1 homo- and heterodimerization might be mutually exclusive. Moreover, isothermal titration calorimetry analyses disclosed that structure-specific recognition protein-1 binds both histones H2A-H2B and H3-H4 and that disruption of structure-specific recognition protein-1 homodimerization decreases its histone-binding affinity. Together, our results provide evidence for regulation of structure-specific recognition protein-1 by homodimerization and suggest a potential role for homodimerization in facilitating SPT16-independent functions of structure-specific recognition protein-1.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Structure-specific recognition protein-1 protein] and [PH2 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of an interaction between "Structure-specific recognition protein-1 protein" and "PH2 protein". The text refers to a "PH2 region" of the Structure-specific recognition protein-1 (SSRP1), but it does not mention a separate "PH2 protein".  The context states that the PH2 region is part of SSRP1 and is involved in both homodimerization of SSRP1 and heterodimerization with SPT16. However, it does not describe an interaction between two separate proteins named SSRP1 and PH2.  The low confidence is due to the possibility that "PH2 protein" might be a shorthand reference to the PH2 region of SSRP1 that I'm not aware of, or it could be mentioned in a part of the context that was not provided. However, based solely on the given information, there is no evidence of an interaction between two separate proteins with these names.
33125 2A2769796 2A2769798	RECQL4	RECQL5	[INST]Context: [PMID: 26499077 Decreased RECQL5 correlated with disease progression of osteosarcoma. Human RecQ helicase family, consisting of RECQL, RECQL4, RECQL5, BLM and WRN, has critical roles in genetic stability and tumorigenesis. Although RECQL5 has been reported to correlate with the susceptibility to malignances including osteosarcoma, the specific effect on tumor genesis and progression is not yet clarified. Here we focused on the relationship between RECQL5 expression and osteosarcoma disease progression, and further investigated the function of RECQL5 on MG-63 cell proliferation and apoptosis. By immunohistochemical analysis, qRT-PCR and western blot, we found that RECQL5 expression was downregulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cells. Patients with advanced tumor stage and low grade expressed lower RECQL5. To construct a stable RECQL5 overexpression osteosarcoma cell line (MG-63-RECQL5), RECQL5 gene was inserted into the human AAVS1 safe harbor by CRISPR/Cas9 system. The overexpression of RECQL5 was verified by qRT-PCR and western blot. Cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis assay revealed that RECQL5 overexpression inhibited proliferation, induced G1-phase arrest and promoted apoptosis in MG-63 cells. Collectively, our results suggested RECQL5 as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma and may be a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma treatment.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [RECQL4 protein] and [RECQL5 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Explanation: The provided context does not explicitly mention any direct interaction between RECQL4 protein and RECQL5 protein. While both proteins are mentioned as being part of the human RecQ helicase family, which "has critical roles in genetic stability and tumorigenesis," the text primarily focuses on RECQL5 and its role in osteosarcoma progression.  The context discusses RECQL5's expression levels in osteosarcoma tissues and cells, its correlation with tumor stage and grade, and its effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis when overexpressed. However, it does not provide any information about RECQL4's specific role or any interaction between RECQL4 and RECQL5.  Given that both proteins belong to the same family and may have related functions in maintaining genetic stability, there is a possibility that they could interact or have some functional relationship. However, without explicit evidence of interaction in the given context, we cannot conclude that they interact.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no direct evidence of interaction, the proteins' shared family membership and related functions in genetic stability leave open the possibility of some form of interaction that is not mentioned in this specific context.
183716 2A2572260 2A2685847	GLUT3	Notch1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 24878247 Role of notch signaling in the maintenance of human mesenchymal stem cells under hypoxic conditions. Human adipose tissue-derived multilineage progenitor cells (hADMPCs) are attractive for cell therapy and tissue engineering because of their multipotency and ease of isolation without serial ethical issues. However, their limited in vitro lifespan in culture systems hinders their therapeutic application. Some somatic stem cells, including hADMPCs, are known to be localized in hypoxic regions; Thus, hypoxia may be beneficial for ex vivo culture of these stem cells. These cells exhibit a high level of glycolytic metabolism in the presence of high oxygen levels and further increase their glycolysis rate under hypoxia. Here, we show that Notch signaling is required for glycolysis regulation under hypoxic conditions. Our results demonstrate that 5% O2 dramatically increased the glycolysis rate, improved the proliferation efficiency, prevented senescence, and maintained the multipotency of hADMPCs. Intriguingly, these effects were not mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor, but rather by the Notch signaling pathway. Five percent O2 significantly increased the level of activated Notch1 and expression of its downstream gene, HES1. Furthermore, 5% O2 markedly increased glucose consumption and lactate production of hADMPCs, which decreased back to normoxic levels on treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor. We also found that HES1 was involved in induction of GLUT3, TPI, and PGK1 in addition to reduction of TIGAR and SCO2 expression. These results clearly suggest that Notch signaling regulates glycolysis under hypoxic conditions and, thus, likely affects the cell lifespan via glycolysis.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GLUT3 protein] and [Notch1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence to suggest an interaction between GLUT3 protein and Notch1 protein, albeit indirectly. Here's the reasoning:  1. The context states that 5% O2 (hypoxic conditions) significantly increased the level of activated Notch1 and expression of its downstream gene, HES1.  2. It also mentions that HES1 was involved in the induction of GLUT3, among other genes.  3. This suggests a pathway where Notch1 activation leads to increased HES1 expression, which in turn leads to increased GLUT3 expression.  While there isn't a direct mention of Notch1 protein interacting with GLUT3 protein, there is a clear regulatory pathway connecting them. Notch1 activation appears to indirectly upregulate GLUT3 expression through HES1.  The confidence level is medium because: - The interaction is not direct, but rather part of a signaling cascade. - The context doesn't explicitly state that Notch1 protein and GLUT3 protein interact, but it strongly implies a functional relationship between their activities. - More direct experimental evidence would be needed to establish a high-confidence interaction between these two proteins.

It has been postulated that in the local model, altered Langerhans' cells provide tolerogenic signals, and studies in vitro have indicated that ultraviolet radiation may down-regulate the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of these cells. To examine the effect of ultraviolet radiation on langerhans' cells co-stimulatory molecules in vivo, we irradiated human volunteers with erythematogenic doses of solar-simulating ultraviolet radiation (SSR), and analyzed the expression of cell surface markers in dermatome skin samples obtained 1-72 h post-irradiation. For flow cytometric analysis, epidermal cell suspensions were prepared and double labeled with monoclonal antibodies against CD1a or HLA-DR, and B7-1 (CD80), B7-2 (CD86), ICAM-1 (CD54), ICAM-3 (CD50), LFA-3 (CD58), E-cadherin, or integrin-beta4 (CD104). In unirradiated control skin samples, keratinocytes expressed high levels of E-cadherin. Langerhans' cells expressed high levels of both E-cadherin and ICAM-3, and low levels of B7-2, LFA-3, ICAM-1, and integrin-beta4. Following SSR, a triphasic reaction pattern was seen: an immediate, down-regulatory phase prevailing 2-6 h post-irradiation, when the number of DR+ and CD1a+ cells were temporarily reduced; A delayed, up-regulatory phase in which the number of langerhans' cells was increased and the expression intensities of CD1a, HLA-DR, B7-1, and B7-2 were strongly up-regulated, maximally evident 12-24 h after irradiation, but no more seen at 48 h; And a late phase at 72 h, in which an influx of monocytes and a concomitant rise in DR+ cells was recorded. In the case of langerhans' cells, the effects of erythematogenic ultraviolet radiation in vivo on human langerhans' cells B7 co-stimulatory molecules include an up-regulatory stage.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [LFA-3 protein] and [ICAM-3 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of an interaction between LFA-3 protein (CD58) and ICAM-3 protein (CD50). The text describes these molecules as separate cell surface markers expressed on Langerhans' cells, but does not indicate any direct interaction or relationship between them.  The context primarily focuses on describing the expression levels of various surface markers on Langerhans' cells before and after solar-simulating irradiation. LFA-3 and ICAM-3 are mentioned alongside other molecules like B7-1, B7-2, ICAM-1, E-cadherin, and integrin-beta4, but their individual expression patterns are described rather than any interactions between them.  While both LFA-3 and ICAM-3 are adhesion molecules involved in immune cell interactions, the provided context does not discuss their functional relationships or any potential interactions.

Non-canonical WNT and planar cell polarity are overlapping but distinct signaling pathways, which control convergent extension, neural tube closure, orientation of cilia and sensory hair cells, axon guidance, and cell motility. Non-canonical WNT signals, regulated by the interaction of WNT, WNT antagonist, Frizzled and ROR2, are transduced to JNK, ROCK, PKC, MAP3K7, and NFAT signaling cascades. Planar cell polarity signals, regulated by the interaction of VANGL-PRICKLE complex, CELSR and Frizzled-DVL complex, are transduced to JNK, ROCK, and other uncharacterized signaling cascades. PTK7 signaling, regulated by SEMA6 and Plexin-A family members, affects planar cell polarity pathway through VANGL. Here, integrative genomic analyses on WNT5A, WNT5B, WNT11, FZD3, FZD6, ROR1, ROR2, RYK, CELSR1, CELSR2, CELSR3, VANGL1, VANGL2, PRICKLE1, PRICKLE2, PTK7, SEMA6A, SEMA6B, SEMA6C and SEMA6D were carried out. PTK7 and SEMA6A were expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells, SEMA6A in endodermal progenitors, CELSR1, VANGL1 and PTK7 in gastrointestinal tumors. CELSR2, PRICKLE2 and SEMA6C were expressed in fetal brain, CELSR2, PRICKLE1 and SEMA6A in adult brain, WNT5A and CELSR3 in adult brain tumors. These facts indicate class switches of non-canonical WNT or planar cell polarity signaling molecules during embryogenesis and carcinogenesis. TCF/LEF-, SP1-, and 5 bHLH-binding sites within human PTK7 promoter were conserved in chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, mouse, and rat PTK7 orthologs, which explained the mechanism of PTK7 upregulation in colorectal cancer. NANOG-, SOX2-, and POU5F1 (OCT3/OCT4)-binding sites within intron 1 of the human SEMA6A gene were conserved in chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, mouse, and rat SEMA6A orthologs, which explained the mechanism of SEMA6A upregulation in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells. Most of non-canonical WNT or planar cell polarity signaling molecules, except PTK7 and SEMA6A, were not frequently expressed in undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells.

426337 2A2459794 2A2690113	Cdk4	NTF2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 11310559 Identification of nuclear-import and cell-cycle regulatory proteins that bind to prothymosin alpha. Prothymosin alpha (ProT alpha) is a nuclear protein that is widely distributed in mammalian tissues, and is thought to play a role in cell proliferation. In an attempt to shed light on this role, affinity chromatography on ProT alpha-Sepharose columns was used to identify proteins in subcellular extracts of transformed human lymphocytes (NC37 cells) that interact with ProT alpha in vitro, and thus may interact with ProT alpha in vivo. Immunoblotting techniques were used to screen the ProT alpha-binding fractions for histones and other proteins involved in nuclear transport and cell-cycle control. The most abundant ProT alpha-binding proteins were histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Of the nuclear-transport proteins, karyopherin beta1, Rch-1, Ran, and RCC1 were detected at high concentrations; NTF2, nucleoporin p62, and Hsp70 were detected at low concentrations; While tranportin, CAS, and Ran BPI were not detected. Of the cell-cycle control proteins, PCNA, Cdk2, and cyclin A were detected at high concentrations; Cdc2, Cdk4, and cyclin B were detected at very low concentrations; While cyclin D1, cyclin D3, Cip1, and Kip1 were not detected. These results suggest (i) that ProT alpha is transported into the nucleus by the karyopherin beta1-Rch-1 complex, and (ii) that ProT alpha may interact in the nucleus with proteins involved in DNA metabolism and cell-cycle control.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Cdk4 protein] and [NTF2 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone."

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence.  Based on the provided context, there is no direct indication that Cdk4 protein and NTF2 protein interact with each other. The passage mentions both proteins, but they are listed separately as proteins that bind to prothymosin alpha (ProT alpha) at different concentrations. Specifically:  1. NTF2 is mentioned as being detected at low concentrations among the nuclear-transport proteins that bind to ProT alpha. 2. Cdk4 is mentioned as being detected at very low concentrations among the cell-cycle control proteins that bind to ProT alpha.  However, the text does not provide any information about a direct interaction between Cdk4 and NTF2. They are simply listed as separate proteins that can bind to ProT alpha under different circumstances.   The low confidence in this assessment stems from the fact that while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, the study focused on interactions with ProT alpha and not necessarily on interactions between the proteins that bind to it. Therefore, it's possible that Cdk4 and NTF2 could interact in ways not explored or mentioned in this specific study.

GFG-3a is a novel glycoprotein previously purified from the fermented mycelia of Grifola frondosa with novel sugar compositions and protein sequencing. The present study aims to investigate its effects on the cell cycle, differential proteins expression, and apoptosis of human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells. Our findings revealed that GFG-3a induced the cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at S phase. GFG-3a treatment resulted in the differential expression of 21 proteins in SGC-7901 cells by upregulating 10 proteins including RBBP4 associated with cell cycle arrest and downregulating 11 proteins including RUVBL1, NPM, HSP90AB1, and GRP78 involved in apoptosis and stress response. QRT-PCR and Western blot analysis also suggested that GFG-3a could increase the expressions of Caspase-8/-3, p53, Bax, and Bad while decrease the expressions of Bcl2, Bcl-xl, PI3K, and Akt1. These results indicated that the stress response, p53-dependent mitochondrial-mediated, Caspase-8/-3-dependent, and PI3k/Akt pathways were involved in the GFG-3a-induced apoptosis process in SGC-7901 cells. These findings might provide a basis to prevent or treat human gastric cancer with GFG-3a and understand the tumor-inhibitory molecular mechanisms of mushroom glycoproteins.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [HSP90AB1 protein] and [RUVBL1 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of direct interaction between HSP90AB1 and RUVBL1 proteins. The passage states that both proteins are downregulated by GFG-3a treatment in SGC-7901 cells, and they are involved in apoptosis and stress response. However, being downregulated together or being involved in similar processes does not necessarily mean that these proteins interact with each other directly.  The text groups these proteins together as part of a list of downregulated proteins, but it does not provide any information about their specific relationship or interaction. Without further information about how these proteins might work together or influence each other's functions, we cannot conclude that they interact.  The confidence level is medium because while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, it's possible that these proteins could interact in ways not mentioned in this specific passage. Further research would be needed to definitively rule out any interaction between HSP90AB1 and RUVBL1.

Although the treatment of brain tumors by targeting kinase-regulated macroautophagy/autophagy, is under investigation, the precise mechanism underlying autophagy initiation and its significance in glioblastoma remains to be defined. Here, we report that PAK1 (p21 [RAC1] activated kinase 1) is significantly upregulated and promotes glioblastoma development. The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis suggests that the oncogenic role of PAK1 in glioblastoma is mainly associated with autophagy. Subsequent experiments demonstrate that PAK1 indeed serves as a positive modulator for hypoxia-induced autophagy in glioblastoma. Mechanistically, hypoxia induces ELP3-mediated PAK1 acetylation at K420, which suppresses the dimerization of PAK1 and enhances its activity, thereby leading to subsequent PAK1-mediated ATG5 (autophagy related 5) phosphorylation at the T101 residue. This event not only protects ATG5 from ubiquitination-dependent degradation but also increases the affinity between the ATG12-ATG5 complex and ATG16L1 (autophagy related 16 like 1). Consequently, ELP3-dependent PAK1 (K420) acetylation and PAK1-mediated ATG5 (T101) phosphorylation are required for hypoxia-induced autophagy and brain tumorigenesis by promoting autophagosome formation. Silencing PAK1 with shRNA or small molecule inhibitor FRAX597 potentially blocks autophagy and glioblastoma growth. Furthermore, SIRT1-mediated PAK1-deacetylation at K420 hinders autophagy and glioblastoma growth. Clinically, the levels of PAK1 (K420) acetylation significantly correlate with the expression of ATG5 (T101) phosphorylation in glioblastoma patients. Together, this report uncovers that the acetylation modification and kinase activity of PAK1 plays an instrumental role in hypoxia-induced autophagy initiation and maintaining glioblastoma growth. Therefore, PAK1 and its regulator in the autophagy pathway might represent potential therapeutic targets for glioblastoma treatment.Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; Ac-CoA: acetyl coenzyme A; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG16L1, autophagy related 16 like 1; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; CDC42: cell division cycle 42; CHX, cycloheximide; ELP3: elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 3; Glioblastoma, glioblastoma; MAP1LC3B/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MAP2K1: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1; MAPK14, mitogen-activated protein kinase 14; PAK1: p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 1; PDK1: pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; PGK1, phosphoglycerate kinase 1; RAC1: Rac family small GTPase 1; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta protein] and [Rac family small GTPase 1 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any direct interaction between microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (MAP1LC3B/LC3) and Rac family small GTPase 1 (RAC1) proteins.   The context primarily focuses on the role of PAK1 (p21 [RAC1] activated kinase 1) in autophagy and glioblastoma development. While RAC1 is mentioned as part of PAK1's full name, it is not discussed further in the context. Similarly, MAP1LC3B/LC3 is only mentioned in the abbreviations list and not in the main text.  The main interactions described in the context involve: 1. PAK1 and ATG5 2. PAK1 and ELP3 (for acetylation) 3. ATG5 and ATG12-ATG16L1 complex  Without any explicit mention of interaction between MAP1LC3B/LC3 and RAC1, we cannot conclude that these two proteins interact based on the given information. However, since both proteins are involved in cellular processes (autophagy and cell signaling, respectively), there might be indirect connections not mentioned in this specific context, which is why the confidence level is medium rather than high.
492668 2A2872905 2A2574471	structure-specific recognition protein 1	H2AX	[INST]Context: [PMID: 19639603 A role for structure-specific recognition protein 1 in recombination-mediated DNA damage response. A possible role for structure-specific recognition protein 1 in replication-associated repair processes has previously been suggested based on its interaction with several DNA repair factors and the replication defects observed in structure-specific recognition protein 1 mutants. In this study, we investigated the potential role of structure-specific recognition protein 1 in association with DNA repair mediated by homologous recombination, one of the pathways involved in repairing replication-associated DNA damage, in mammalian cells. Surprisingly, over-expression of structure-specific recognition protein 1 reduced the number of hprt(+) recombinants generated via homologous recombination both spontaneously and upon hydroxyurea treatment, whereas knockdown of structure-specific recognition protein 1 resulted in an increase of homologous recombination events in response to DNA double-strand break formation. In correlation, we found that the depletion of structure-specific recognition protein 1 in HU-treated human cells elevated the number of Rad51 and H2AX foci, while over-expression of the wild-type structure-specific recognition protein 1 markedly reduced HU-induced Rad51 foci formation. We also found that structure-specific recognition protein 1 physically interacts with a key homologous recombination repair protein, Rad54 both in vitro and in vivo. Further, branch migration studies demonstrated that structure-specific recognition protein 1 inhibits Rad54-promoted branch migration of Holliday junctions in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest a functional role for structure-specific recognition protein 1 in spontaneous and replication-associated DNA damage response by suppressing avoidable homologous recombination repair events.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [structure-specific recognition protein 1 protein] and [H2AX protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1) and H2AX protein. While both proteins are mentioned in the text, they are not described as directly interacting with each other.  The context does mention that depletion of SSRP1 in HU-treated human cells elevated the number of H2AX foci, along with Rad51 foci. However, this observation does not necessarily imply a direct interaction between SSRP1 and H2AX. Instead, it suggests that SSRP1 may indirectly influence the formation of H2AX foci, possibly through its role in DNA damage response and repair processes.  The text explicitly states that SSRP1 physically interacts with Rad54, a key homologous recombination repair protein, both in vitro and in vivo. However, no such direct interaction is mentioned for SSRP1 and H2AX.  Given the lack of explicit evidence for direct interaction between SSRP1 and H2AX, and the presence of information suggesting only an indirect relationship, the conclusion is that these two proteins do not interact in the manner described in the question. The confidence is medium because while there is no direct evidence of interaction, the proteins are involved in related cellular processes, and further research might reveal additional relationships between them.
453107 2A2443736 2A2419976	BIN-1	ADP-ribosylation factor 1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 32075937 Identification of Host Trafficking Genes Required for HIV-1 Virological Synapse Formation in Dendritic Cells. Dendritic cells are one of the earliest targets of HIV-1 infection acting as a 'Trojan horse,' concealing the virus from the innate immune system and delivering it to T cells via virological synapses . To explicate how the virus is trafficked through the cell to the virological synapses and evades degradation, a high-throughput small interfering RNA screen targeting membrane trafficking proteins was performed in monocyte-derived dendritic cells. We identified several proteins including BIN-1 and RAB7L1 that share common roles in transport from endosomal compartments. By targeting endocytic trafficking and retromer recycling to the plasma membrane, we were able to reduce the virus's ability to accumulate at budding microdomains and the virological synapses. Thus, we identify key genes involved in a pathway within dendritic cells that is exploited by HIV-1 to traffic to the virological synapses.IMPORTANCE The lentivirus human immunodeficiency virus targets and destroys CD4+ T cells, leaving the host vulnerable to life-threatening opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. Dendritic cells form a virological synapse with CD4+ T cells, enabling the efficient transfer of virus between the two cells. We show that ADP-ribosylation factor 1, bridging integrator 1, and Rab GTPases RAB7L1 and RAB8A are important regulators of HIV-1 trafficking to the virological synapses and therefore the infection of CD4+ T cells. We found these cellular factors were essential for endosomal protein trafficking and formation of the virological synapses and that depletion of target proteins prevented virus trafficking to the plasma membrane by retaining virus in intracellular vesicles. Identification of key regulators in HIV-1 trans-infection between DC and CD4+ T cells has the potential for the development of targeted therapy to reduce trans-infection of HIV-1 in vivo.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of interaction between BIN-1 protein and ADP-ribosylation factor 1 protein. Both proteins are mentioned as being important for HIV-1 trafficking to virological synapses, but they are not described as interacting with each other directly.  The context states that BIN-1 (bridging integrator 1) and RAB7L1 were identified as proteins that "share common roles in transport from endosomal compartments." Separately, it mentions that ADP-ribosylation factor 1 is an important regulator of HIV-1 trafficking to the virological synapses.  While these proteins may be part of the same cellular pathway involved in HIV-1 trafficking, the text does not provide evidence of a direct interaction between BIN-1 and ADP-ribosylation factor 1. They appear to be separate components in the process of virus trafficking and virological synapse formation.  The confidence level is medium because while there is no explicit mention of interaction, the possibility of indirect interaction through shared pathways cannot be completely ruled out based on the limited information provided.

The HLCs were characterized biochemically, i.e. glycogen storage, ICG uptake and release, UREA and bile acid production, as well as CYP3A4 activity.

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit indication of an interaction between DLK protein and Albumin protein. The passage mentions these proteins as markers for different stages of hepatic differentiation:  "DLK and HNF6 the HE stage, HNF4alpha and Albumin is specific to HLCs, fetal liver and adult liver stage."  This information suggests that DLK is expressed at the hepatic endoderm (HE) stage, while Albumin is expressed later in hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) and liver stages. The text does not describe any direct interaction or relationship between these two proteins beyond their roles as stage-specific markers.  While it's possible that these proteins could interact in some way during liver development, the given context does not provide any evidence for such an interaction. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, we cannot conclude that DLK protein and Albumin protein interact with each other.

BACKGROUND: An efficacious anti-inflammatory corticosteroid with reduced side effects has been long sought. We report the pooled results from three clinical proof-of-mechanism Phase I studies of BI 653048 in healthy subjects, a functionally selective, nonsteroidal glucocorticoid . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three Phase I trials were conducted: a single rising-dose study and a multiple rising-dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of BI 653048, and a multiple parallel-arm-dose study with intravenous lipopolysaccharide challenge to assess in vivo pharmacodynamics. The pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety of BI 653048 and prednisolone were compared.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit indication that ZBTB16 protein and DDIT4 protein interact with each other. The passage mentions these two proteins together in a single sentence: "Comparable levels of FKBP5, ZBTB16, and DDIT4 expression were observed." However, this statement only indicates that the expression levels of these proteins were similar when comparing the effects of BI 653048 and prednisolone. It does not suggest any direct interaction between ZBTB16 and DDIT4.  The context primarily focuses on comparing the effects of BI 653048 and prednisolone on various biomarkers and inflammatory responses. While ZBTB16 and DDIT4 are mentioned together, there is no information provided about their potential interaction or relationship beyond their similar expression levels in response to the treatments.  Given the limited information provided and the lack of any explicit statement about interaction between these two proteins, we cannot conclude that they interact. However, the confidence level is low because the context does not provide enough information to rule out the possibility of interaction entirely.
403866 2A2592161 2A2589914	Hsp70	HSPH1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 22321511 Thiostrepton is an inducer of oxidative and proteotoxic stress that impairs viability of human melanoma cells but not primary melanocytes. Pharmacological induction of oxidative and proteotoxic stress has recently emerged as a promising strategy for chemotherapeutic intervention targeting cancer cells. Guided by a differential phenotypic drug screen for novel lead compounds that selectively induce melanoma cell apoptosis without compromising viability of primary human melanocytes, we have focused on the cyclic pyridinyl-polythiazolyl peptide-antimicrobial thiostrepton. Using comparative gene expression-array analysis, the early cellular stress response induced by thiostrepton was examined in human A375 metastatic melanoma cells and primary melanocytes. Thiostrepton displayed selective antimelanoma activity causing early induction of proteotoxic stress with massive upregulation of heat shock (HSPA6, HSPA1A, DNAJB4, HSPB1, HSPH1, HSPA1L, CRYAB, HSPA5, DNAJA1), oxidative stress (HMOX1, GSR, SOD1), and ER stress response (DDIT3) gene expression, confirmed by immunodetection (Hsp70, Hsp70B', HO-1, phospho-eIF2alpha). Moreover, upregulation of p53, proapoptotic modulation of Bcl-2 family members (Bax, Noxa, Mcl-1, Bcl-2), and induction of apoptotic cell death were observed. Thiostrepton rapidly induced cellular oxidative stress followed by inactivation of chymotrypsin-like proteasomal activity and melanoma cell-directed accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, not observed in melanocytes that were resistant to thiostrepton-induced apoptosis. In RPMI 8226 multiple myeloma cells, known to be exquisitely sensitive to proteasome inhibition, early proteotoxic and apoptogenic effects of thiostrepton were confirmed by array analysis indicating pronounced upregulation of heat shock response gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that thiostrepton displays dual activity as a selective prooxidant and proteotoxic chemotherapeutic, suggesting feasibility of experimental intervention targeting metastatic melanoma and other malignancies including multiple myeloma.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Hsp70 protein] and [HSPH1 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence to suggest that Hsp70 protein and HSPH1 protein are interacting in a similar way, though not directly stated. Here's why:  1. Both proteins are mentioned as part of the heat shock response gene expression that is upregulated in response to thiostrepton treatment.  2. The context states: "Thiostrepton displayed selective antimelanoma activity causing early induction of proteotoxic stress with massive upregulation of heat shock (HSPA6, HSPA1A, DNAJB4, HSPB1, HSPH1, HSPA1L, CRYAB, HSPA5, DNAJA1) ... gene expression."  3. Hsp70 is likely referring to HSPA1A or HSPA1L, which are listed alongside HSPH1 in the group of upregulated heat shock proteins.  4. The fact that these proteins are upregulated together in response to the same stimulus (thiostrepton treatment) suggests they are part of the same cellular stress response pathway and likely interact functionally, if not physically.  However, the context does not explicitly state a direct interaction between Hsp70 and HSPH1, which is why the confidence level is medium rather than high. The interaction is inferred from their shared involvement in the cellular stress response pathway triggered by thiostrepton.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder affecting 1-5% of the general population for which neither effective cure nor early diagnostic tools are available that could tackle the pathology in the early phase. Here we report a multi-stage procedure to identify candidate genes likely involved in the etiopathogenesis of parkinson's disease. METHODS: The study includes a discovery stage based on the analysis of whole exome data from 26 dominant late onset parkinson's disease families, a validation analysis performed on 1542 independent parkinson's disease patients and 706 controls from different cohorts and the assessment of polygenic variants load in the Italian cohort (394 unrelated patients and 203 controls). RESULTS: Family-based approach identified 28 disrupting variants in 26 candidate genes for parkinson's disease including PARK2, PINK1, DJ-1(PARK7), LRRK2, HTRA2, FBXO7, EIF4G1, DNAJC6, DNAJC13, SNCAIP, AIMP2, CHMP1A, GIPC1, HMOX2, HSPA8, IMMT, KIF21B, KIF24, MAN2C1, RHOT2, SLC25A39, SPTBN1, TMEM175, TOMM22, TVP23A and ZSCAN21. Sixteen of them have not been associated to parkinson's disease before, were expressed in mesencephalon and were involved in pathways potentially deregulated in parkinson's disease. Mutation analysis in independent cohorts disclosed a significant excess of highly deleterious variants in cases (p___=___0.0001), supporting their role in parkinson's disease. Moreover, we demonstrated that the co-inheritance of multiple rare variants (___ 2) in the 26 genes may predict parkinson's disease occurrence in about 20% of patients, both familial and sporadic cases, with high specificity (>___93%; p___=___4.4________10-___5). Moreover, our data highlight the fact that the genetic landmarks of late onset parkinson's disease does not systematically differ between sporadic and familial forms, especially in the case of small nuclear families and underline the importance of rare variants in the genetics of sporadic parkinson's disease. Furthermore, patients carrying multiple rare variants showed higher risk of manifesting dyskinesia induced by levodopa treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Besides confirming the extreme genetic heterogeneity of parkinson's disease, these data provide novel insights into the genetic of the disease and may be relevant for its prediction, diagnosis and treatment.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [PARK2 protein] and [HSPA8 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of an interaction between PARK2 protein and HSPA8 protein. The study identifies both PARK2 and HSPA8 as candidate genes potentially involved in the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, but it does not describe any direct interaction or functional relationship between these two specific proteins.  The context lists these genes among 26 candidate genes identified through whole exome analysis of Parkinson's disease families, but it does not provide information about how these genes or their protein products might interact with each other. Without additional information about the functional relationships or pathways involving these proteins, we cannot conclude that they interact.  The low confidence level is assigned because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, it's possible that such interactions exist but were not mentioned in this particular study or abstract. Further research would be needed to definitively rule out any interaction between PARK2 and HSPA8 proteins in the context of Parkinson's disease.

Ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 and molybdenum cofactor deficiencies are hereditary disorders that affect the catabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. Ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 deficiency is caused by mutations in the ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 gene, while molybdenum cofactor deficiency is due to mutations in one of three genes involved in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis (MOCS1, MOCS2 and GPHN). Patients with both disorders exhibit abnormalities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, among other biochemical findings. To characterize cellular derangements, mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics, endoplasmic reticulum -mitochondria communication, superoxide production and apoptosis were evaluated in fibroblasts from four patients with ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 deficiency and one with MOCS1 deficiency. Our data show that mitochondrial respiration was decreased in all patient cell lines. ATP depletion and increased mitochondrial mass was identified in the same cells, while variable alterations in mitochondrial fusion and fission were seen. High superoxide levels were found in all cells and were decreased by treatment with JP4-039, while the respiratory chain activity was increased by this antioxidant in cells in which it was impaired. The content of VDAC1 and IP3R, proteins involved in ER-mitochondria communication, was decreased, while DDIT3, a marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis were increased in all cell lines. These data demonstrate that previously unrecognized broad disturbances of cellular function are involved in the pathophysiology of ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 and MOCS1 deficiencies, and that reduction of mitochondrial superoxide by JP4-039 is a promising strategy for adjuvant therapy of these disorders.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [MOCS2 protein] and [Ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 protein] interact with each other?

Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention or evidence of interaction between MOCS2 protein and Ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 protein. The text primarily discusses deficiencies in Ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 and MOCS1, but does not describe any interaction between MOCS2 and Ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1.  The context mentions MOCS2 only briefly as one of the genes involved in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis, along with MOCS1 and GPHN. However, the study focuses on Ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 deficiency and MOCS1 deficiency, without providing any information about potential interactions between MOCS2 and Ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1.  Given the lack of specific information about these two proteins interacting, I cannot confidently state that they do interact. However, since they are both involved in related metabolic pathways (sulfur-containing amino acid catabolism and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis), there is a possibility of some indirect interaction or relationship that is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. This is why I've assigned a low confidence to this answer.

BACKGROUND: Mutations in ANK2-encoded ankyrin-B underlie long QT syndrome type 4 (LQT4) and various other dysrhythmia phenotypes. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and spectrum of ankyrin-B mutations in a large cohort of unrelated patients referred for LQTS genetic testing and among healthy control subjects. METHODS: Between August 1997 and July 2004, 541 consecutive, unrelated patients (358 females, average age at diagnosis 24 years, average QTc 482 ms) were referred to Mayo Clinic's Sudden Death Genomics Laboratory for comprehensive mutational analysis of the five cardiac channel genes implicated in LQTS: KCNQ1 (LQT1), KCNH2 (LQT2), SCN5A (LQT3), KCNE1 (LQT5), and KCNE2 (LQT6). In this study, targeted mutational analysis of 10 ANK2 exons (36,37,39-46) encoding the critical C-terminal regulatory domain or implicated previously as hosting pathogenic mutations was performed on genomic DNA from 541 patients and 200 control subjects using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Overall, 14 distinct nonsynonymous variants (10 novel) were observed in 9 (3.3%) of 269 genotype-negative LQTS patients, 5 (1.8%) of 272 genotype-positive LQTS cases, 4 (4%) of 100 white controls, and 9 (9%) of 100 black controls. All genotype-negative LQTS cases hosting ANK2 variants had been diagnosed as 'atypical' or 'borderline' cases, most presenting with normal QTc, nonexertional syncope, U waves, and/or sinus bradycardia. CONCLUSION: Nonsynonymous ankyrin-B variants were detected in nearly 3% of unrelated LQTS patients and nearly 7% of healthy control subjects. Genotype-negative LQTS patients with a single ANK2 variant displayed nonexertional syncope, U waves, sinus bradycardia, and extracardiac findings.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [KCNH2 protein] and [SCN5A protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between KCNH2 protein and SCN5A protein. The information given primarily focuses on:  1. Listing KCNH2 (LQT2) and SCN5A (LQT3) as two of the five cardiac channel genes implicated in Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). 2. Describing a study that involved mutational analysis of these genes along with others (KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2) and ANK2.  The text does not provide any information about how these proteins might interact with each other. Instead, they are presented as separate genes associated with different subtypes of LQTS. While it's possible that these proteins could interact in some way within the broader context of cardiac function, this specific passage does not provide evidence for or against such an interaction.  The confidence is medium because while there is no indication of interaction in the given context, the possibility of interaction cannot be completely ruled out based solely on this information.
358824 2A2737439 2A2539017	parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase	FKBP8	[INST]Context: [PMID: 32048886 Organelle-specific autophagy in inflammatory diseases: a potential therapeutic target underlying the quality control of multiple organelles. Dysfunction of multiple organelles is critically involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular diseases, infection, and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the quality control of multiple organelles is of great importance in maintaining the survival and function of cells and could be a potential therapeutic target for human diseases. Organelle-specific autophagy is one of the major subtypes of autophagy, selectively targeting different organelles for quality control. This type of autophagy includes mitophagy, pexophagy, reticulophagy (endoplasmic reticulum), ribophagy, lysophagy, and nucleophagy. These kinds of organelle-specific autophagy are reported to be beneficial for inflammatory disorders by eliminating damaged organelles and maintaining homeostasis. In this review, we summarized the recent findings and mechanisms covering different kinds of organelle-specific autophagy, as well as their involvement in various diseases, aiming to arouse concern about the significance of the quality control of multiple organelles in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.Abbreviations: ABCD3: ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 3; AD: Alzheimer disease; ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; AMBRA1: autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ARIH1: ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1; ATG: autophagy related; ATM: ATM serine/threonine kinase; BCL2: BCL2 apoptosis regulator; BCL2L11/BIM: BCL2 like 11; BCL2L13: BCL2 like 13; BECN1: beclin 1; BNIP3: BCL2 interacting protein 3; BNIP3L/NIX: BCL2 interacting protein 3 like; CALCOCO2/NDP52: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CANX: calnexin; CAT: catalase; CCPG1: cell cycle progression 1; CHDH: choline dehydrogenase; COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CTSD: cathepsin D; DISC1: DISC1 scaffold protein; DNM1L/DRP1: dynamin 1 like; EIF2AK3/PERK: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3; EIF2S1/eIF2alpha: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3; EMD: emerin; EPAS1/HIF-2alpha: endothelial PAS domain protein 1; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERN1/IRE1alpha: endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 1; FBXO27: F-box protein 27; FKBP8: FKBP prolyl isomerase 8; FTD: frontotemporal dementia; FUNDC1: FUN14 domain containing 1; G3BP1: G3BP stress granule assembly factor 1; HIF1A/HIF1: hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha; IMM: inner mitochondrial membrane; LCLAT1/ALCAT1: lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1; LGALS3/Gal3: galectin 3; LMNA: lamin A/C; LMNB1: lamin B1; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MAPK8/JNK: mitogen-activated protein kinase 8; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MFN1: mitofusin 1; MTPAP: mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase; MUL1: mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1; NBR1: NBR1 autophagy cargo receptor; NLRP3: NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; NUFIP1: nuclear FMR1 interacting protein 1; OMM: outer mitochondrial membrane; OPTN: optineurin; PD: Parkinson disease; PARL: presenilin associated rhomboid like; PEX3: peroxisomal biogenesis factor 3; PGAM5: PGAM family member 5; PHB2: prohibitin 2; PINK1: PTEN induced putative kinase 1; PRKN: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; RB1CC1/FIP200: RB1 inducible coiled-coil 1; RETREG1/FAM134B: reticulophagy regulator 1; RHOT1/MIRO1: ras homolog family member T1; RIPK3/RIP3: receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RTN3: reticulon 3; SEC62: SEC62 homolog, preprotein translocation factor; SESN2: sestrin2; SIAH1: siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1; SNCA: synuclein alpha; SNCAIP: synuclein alpha interacting protein; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; STING1: stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1; TAX1BP1: Tax1 binding protein 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TIMM23: translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 23; TNKS: tankyrase; TOMM: translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane; UCP2: uncoupling protein 2; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase; USP10: ubiquitin specific peptidase 10; VCP/p97: valosin containing protein; XIAP: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis; ZNHIT3: zinc finger HIT-type containing 3.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase protein] and [FKBP8 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of an interaction between parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PRKN) and FKBP8 protein. The text provides a general overview of organelle-specific autophagy and mentions various proteins involved in different types of autophagy, but it does not specifically discuss any interaction between these two proteins.  PRKN is mentioned in the abbreviations list as "parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase," and FKBP8 is listed as "FKBP prolyl isomerase 8." However, the context does not provide any information about their potential interaction or shared functions.  Given the lack of specific information about these two proteins interacting, I cannot confidently state that they do interact. However, it's important to note that the absence of evidence in this specific context does not necessarily mean that these proteins do not interact in other contexts or that such an interaction has not been discovered in other research. This is why I've assigned a low confidence level to this response.
474443 2A2840941 2A2836890	RPS6	RPS28	[INST]Context: [PMID: 18697920 The role of human ribosomal proteins in the maturation of ribosomal rnas and ribosome production. Production of ribosomes is a fundamental process that occurs in all dividing cells. Diamond Blackfan anemia is an inherited red cell aplasia caused by mutations in one of several ribosomal proteins. How defects in ribosomal proteins, essential for proliferation in all cells, lead to a human disease with a specific defect in red cell development is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of ribosomal proteins in ribosome biogenesis in order to find out whether those mutated in diamond blackfan anemia have any similarities. We depleted HeLa cells using siRNA for several individual ribosomal proteins of the small (RPS6, RPS7, RPS15, RPS16, RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, RPS25, RPS28) or large subunit (RPL5, RPL7, RPL11, RPL14, RPL26, RPL35a) and studied the effect on ribosomal rnas processing and ribosome production. R-protein depletion, with a few exceptions, led to the accumulation of specific ribosomal rnas precursors, highlighting their individual roles in ribosomal rnas processing. Depletion of ribosomal proteins mutated in diamond blackfan anemia always compromised ribosome biogenesis while affecting either subunit and disturbing ribosomal rnas processing at different levels, indicating that the rate of ribosome production rather than a specific step in ribosome biogenesis is critical in patients with diamond blackfan anemia.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [RPS6 protein] and [RPS28 protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of direct interaction between RPS6 protein and RPS28 protein. The text discusses the depletion of various ribosomal proteins, including RPS6 and RPS28, but it does not indicate any specific interaction between these two proteins.  The study examines the individual roles of these ribosomal proteins in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome production. While both RPS6 and RPS28 are mentioned as part of the group of small subunit ribosomal proteins studied, the context does not suggest any particular interaction or functional relationship between these two specific proteins.  The medium confidence level is assigned because while there is no evidence of interaction in the given context, the possibility of some indirect or unstated relationship cannot be entirely ruled out, given that both proteins are part of the small ribosomal subunit and are involved in similar cellular processes.
169296 2A2764298 2A2924442	Kras	Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22	[INST]Context: [PMID: 29844011 Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 deficiency leads to myeloid leukemia upon oncogenic Kras activation through a PU.1-dependent mechanism. Ras mutations are commonly observed in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia transform into acute myeloid leukemia in about 10% and 50% of patients, respectively. We show that absence of the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22, a component of the Spt-Ada-GCN5-acetyltransferase chromatin-remodeling complex that is linked to cancer progression, unexpectedly promotes acute myeloid leukemia transformation in mice expressing oncogenic KrasG12D/+ ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 deficiency in KrasG12D/+ mice resulted in shorter survival compared with control mice. This was due to a block in myeloid cell differentiation leading to the generation of acute myeloid leukemia. This effect was cell autonomous because mice transplanted with USP22-deficient KrasG12D/+ cells developed an aggressive disease and died rapidly. The transcriptome profile of USP22-deficient KrasG12D/+ progenitors resembled leukemic stem cells and was highly correlated with genes associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. We show that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 functions as a PU.1 deubiquitylase by positively regulating its protein stability and promoting the expression of PU.1 target genes. Reconstitution of PU.1 overexpression in USP22-deficient KrasG12D/+ progenitors rescued their differentiation. Our findings uncovered an unexpected role for ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 in Ras-induced leukemogenesis and provide further insights into the function of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 in carcinogenesis.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is evidence suggesting an interaction between the Kras protein and Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) protein, although the interaction is not directly stated. Here are the key points supporting this inference:  1. The study focuses on the effects of USP22 deficiency in mice expressing oncogenic KrasG12D/+, indicating a relationship between these two proteins in the context of leukemogenesis.  2. USP22 deficiency in KrasG12D/+ mice resulted in shorter survival and promoted acute myeloid leukemia transformation, suggesting that USP22 normally plays a role in modulating the effects of oncogenic Kras.  3. The transcriptome profile of USP22-deficient KrasG12D/+ progenitors resembled leukemic stem cells, implying that the absence of USP22 alters the gene expression patterns induced by oncogenic Kras.  4. USP22 is shown to function as a PU.1 deubiquitylase, regulating PU.1 protein stability and target gene expression. The rescue of differentiation in USP22-deficient KrasG12D/+ progenitors by PU.1 overexpression suggests that USP22 may indirectly modulate Kras-induced leukemogenesis through PU.1.  While these points strongly suggest an interaction between Kras and USP22, the nature of this interaction is not explicitly described as direct. The interaction appears to be part of a more complex regulatory network involving PU.1 and possibly other factors. Therefore, a medium confidence level is assigned to this interaction.

N-acetyltransferase human participates in a posttranslational modification of the proteins and has been reported to play a role in apoptosis. In this study, the involvement of n-acetyltransferase human in the cytotoxic action of 5-fluorouracil in human squamous cell carcinoma HEp-2 cells was examined. We found that 5-fluorouracil decreased n-acetyltransferase human expression in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. No change was observed after treatment with bleomycin, nedaplatin, mitomycin C, or methotrexate. Interestingly, knockdown of n-acetyltransferase human by small interfering RNA resulted in the downregulation of thymidylate synthase mRNA expression and induced apoptosis. Conversely, n-acetyltransferase human overexpression facilitated cell proliferation independent of the presence of 5-fluorouracil. The effect of n-acetyltransferase human knockdown on the expression of proteins in HEp-2 cells was examined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Profilin 1, CutA, ras-related nuclear protein, annexin A5, enolase 1, and elongation factor 1 alpha 1 were found to be upregulated and 14-3-3eta, tublin, nuclear auto antigenic sperm protein, heat shock protein 70, and heat shock protein 90 were downregulated by knockdown of n-acetyltransferase human.

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any direct interaction between elongation factor 1 alpha 1 protein and annexin A5 protein. Both proteins are listed among those that were found to be upregulated when n-acetyltransferase human was knocked down in HEp-2 cells. However, the text does not provide any information about these two proteins interacting with each other or having any combined effects.  The context only states that these proteins were similarly affected (both upregulated) by the knockdown of n-acetyltransferase human, but this does not necessarily imply an interaction between them. Without further information, we cannot conclude that these two proteins interact.  The confidence is low because while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, the possibility of an interaction cannot be completely ruled out based solely on this limited information.
361503 2A2454391 2A2871148	CTSB	sequestosome 1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 31282275 Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant pro-cathepsin D corrects defective proteolysis and autophagy in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Cathepsin D is one of the major lysosomal proteases indispensable for the maintenance of cellular proteostasis by turning over substrates of endocytosis, phagocytosis and autophagy. Consequently, cathepsin D deficiency leads to a strong impairment of the lysosomal-autophagy machinery. In mice and humans cathepsin D dysfunction underlies the congenital variant (CLN10) of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis . NCLs are distinct lysosomal storage disorders sharing various hallmarks, namely accumulation of protein aggregates and ceroid lipofuscin leading to neurodegeneration and blindness. Here we reveal that recombinant human pro-cathepsin D produced in a mammalian expression system can be efficiently taken up by a variety of cell models, is correctly targeted to lysosomes and processed to the active mature form of the protease. In proof-of-principle experiments we provide evidence that recombinant human cathepsin D can improve the biochemical phenotype of CTSD-deficient hippocampal slice cultures in vitro and retinal cells in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dosing of recombinant human ctsd in the murine CLN10 model leads to a correction of lysosomal hypertrophy, storage accumulation and impaired autophagic flux in the viscera and central nervous system . We establish that direct delivery of the recombinant protease to the central nervous system is required for improvement of neuropathology and lifespan extension. Together these data support the continuation of the pre-clinical studies for the application of recombinant human ctsd in the treatment of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.Abbreviations: AIF1/IBA1: allograft inflammatory factor 1; CTSB: cathepsin B; CTSD: cathepsin D; CTSL: cathepsin L; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LAMP2: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; LRP1: low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1; M6P: mannose 6-phosphate; NCL: neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; PB: phosphate buffer; LRPAP1: low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein associated protein 1; RhCTSD: human recombinant cathepsin D; SAPC: saposin C; SAPD: saposin D; ATP5G1: ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F0 complex, subunit C1 (subunit 9); SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TPP1: tripeptidyl peptidase I.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CTSB protein] and [sequestosome 1 protein] interact with each other?

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between CTSB (cathepsin B) protein and SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) protein. The text primarily focuses on cathepsin D (CTSD) and its role in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). While both CTSB and SQSTM1/p62 are mentioned in the abbreviations list, there is no information provided about their direct interaction or functional relationship.  The low confidence in this answer stems from the fact that the context does not provide comprehensive information about all potential protein interactions. It's possible that these proteins could interact in ways not mentioned in this specific text. Additionally, both proteins are involved in lysosomal and autophagic processes, which suggests they might be part of related cellular pathways, but this does not necessarily imply a direct interaction.  To definitively determine if these proteins interact, additional research or experimental evidence would be required.
143231 2A2535594 2A2764209	FBW7	RASSF1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 26900348 Tumor suppressor genes and their underlying interactions in paclitaxel resistance in cancer therapy. OBJECTIVES: Paclitaxel is frequently used in the clinical treatment of solid tumors. Exploration of the mechanisms of drug resistance suggests that tumor suppressor genes play a key role in the response of chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, an overview of the contribution of tumor suppressor genes to paclitaxel resistance and their underlying relationship in cancers are reported by using GeneMANIA, a web-based tool for gene/protein function prediction. METHODS: Using PubMed online database and Google web site, the terms 'paclitaxel resistance' or 'taxol resistance' or 'drug resistance' or 'chemotherapy resistance', and 'cancer' or 'carcinoma', and 'tumor suppressor genes' or 'TSGs' or 'negative regulated protein' or 'antioncogenes' were searched and analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 22 tumor suppressor genes involved in paclitaxel resistance, including BRCA1, TP53, PTEN, APC, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, HIN-1, RASSF1, YAP, ING4, PLK2, FBW7, BLU, LZTS1, REST, FADD, PDCD4, TGFBI, ING1, Bax, PinX1 and hEx. The tumor suppressor genes were found to have direct and indirect relationships with each other, and thus they could contribute to paclitaxel resistance as a group. The varied expression status and regulation function of the tumor suppressor genes on cell cycle in different cancers might play an important role in paclitaxel resistance. CONCLUSION: A further understanding of the roles of tumor suppressor genes in drug resistance is an important step to overcome chemotherapy tolerance. Tumor suppressor gene therapy targets the altered genes and signaling pathways and can be a new strategy to reverse chemotherapy resistance.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [FBW7 protein] and [RASSF1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, low confidence   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is a suggestion that FBW7 and RASSF1 proteins might interact, but the confidence in this interaction is low. The text mentions that "The tumor suppressor genes were found to have direct and indirect relationships with each other, and thus they could contribute to paclitaxel resistance as a group." Both FBW7 and RASSF1 are listed among the 22 tumor suppressor genes identified as involved in paclitaxel resistance.  However, the context does not provide specific information about a direct interaction between FBW7 and RASSF1 proteins. The relationship between these two proteins could be indirect, as part of the larger network of tumor suppressor genes involved in paclitaxel resistance. Without more detailed information about their specific interactions, we can only infer a possible connection based on their shared involvement in paclitaxel resistance mechanisms.  The low confidence stems from the lack of explicit evidence of a direct interaction between these two proteins in the given context. To increase confidence in their interaction, more specific data about their functional or physical associations would be needed.
672030 2A2723964 2A2401969	PNPLA2	ACACA	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34572917 Serum Levels of the Cytokine TWEAK Are Associated with Metabolic Status in Patients with Prostate Cancer and Modulate Cancer Cell Lipid Metabolism In Vitro. Soluble TWEAK has been proposed as a prognostic biomarker of prostate cancer . We found that reduced serum levels of soluble tweak, together with higher levels of prostate-specific antigen and a higher HOMA-IR index, are independent predictors of prostate cancer. We also showed that soluble tweak stimulus failed to alter the expression of glucose transporter genes (SLC2A4 and SLC2A1), but significantly reduced the expression of glucose metabolism-related genes (PFK, HK1 and PDK4) in prostate cancer cells. The soluble tweak stimulation of PC-3 cells significantly increased the expression of the genes related to lipogenesis (ACACA and FASN), lipolysis (CPT1A and PNPLA2), lipid transport (FABP4 and CD36) and lipid regulation (SREBP-1 and PPARG) and increased the lipid uptake. Silencing the TWEAK receptor (Fn14) in PC-3 cells confirmed the observed lipid metabolic effects, as shown by the downregulation of ACACA, FASN, CPT1A, PNPLA2, FABP4, CD36, SREBP-1 and PPARG expression, which was paralleled by a reduction of FASN, CPT1A and FABP4 protein expression. Specific-signaling inhibitor assays show that ERK1/2 and AKT (ser473) phosphorylation can regulate lipid metabolism-related genes in prostate cancer cells, pointing to the AKT locus as a possible target for prostate cancer. Overall, our data support sTWEAK/Fn14 axis as a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [PNPLA2 protein] and [ACACA protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, medium confidence.   Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a direct interaction between PNPLA2 protein and ACACA protein. However, the context does suggest that both proteins are related to lipid metabolism in prostate cancer cells and are affected by soluble TWEAK stimulation.  The passage states that soluble TWEAK stimulation "significantly increased the expression of the genes related to lipogenesis (ACACA and FASN), lipolysis (CPT1A and PNPLA2)," among others. This indicates that both ACACA and PNPLA2 are upregulated in response to TWEAK stimulation, but it does not necessarily mean they interact with each other directly.  Furthermore, when Fn14 (the TWEAK receptor) was silenced, both ACACA and PNPLA2 expression were downregulated, along with other lipid metabolism-related genes. This suggests that these proteins are regulated by the same pathway, but again, it does not indicate a direct interaction between them.  While both proteins are involved in lipid metabolism and are regulated by the same signaling pathway, the context does not provide evidence of a direct interaction between PNPLA2 and ACACA proteins. Therefore, the answer is NO, with medium confidence due to the lack of specific information about their interaction.
104567 2A2576391 2A2865793	HBB	SMARCB1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34261517 BACKGROUND: Renal medullary carcinomas are rare kidney cancers that occur in adolescents and young adults of African ancestry. Although RMC is associated with the sickle cell trait and somatic loss of the tumor suppressor, SMARCB1, the ancestral origins of RMC remain unknown. Further, characterization of structural variants involving SMARCB1 in RMC remains limited. METHODS: We used linked-read genome sequencing to reconstruct germline and somatic haplotypes in 15 unrelated patients with RMC registered on the Children's Oncology Group AREN03B2 study between 2006 and 2017 or from our prior study. We performed fine-mapping of the HBB locus and assessed the germline for cancer predisposition genes. Subsequently, we assessed the tumor samples for mutations outside of SMARCB1 and integrated RNA sequencing to interrogate the structural variants at the SMARCB1 locus. RESULTS: We find that the haplotype of the sickle cell mutation in patients with RMC originated from three geographical regions in Africa. In addition, fine-mapping of the HBB locus identified the sickle cell mutation as the sole candidate variant. We further identify that the SMARCB1 structural variants are characterized by blunt or 1-bp homology events. Furthermore, we find that the structural variants that disrupt SMARCB1 function are likely repaired by non-homologous end-joining.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [HBB protein] and [SMARCB1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence  Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between the HBB protein and the SMARCB1 protein. The text discusses these two genes/proteins separately in different contexts:  1. HBB (hemoglobin beta) is mentioned in relation to the sickle cell trait, which is associated with renal medullary carcinoma (RMC).  2. SMARCB1 is discussed as a tumor suppressor gene that is lost in RMC tumors.  While both are relevant to RMC, the text does not provide any information suggesting a direct interaction between these two proteins. They appear to be involved in different aspects of the disease: HBB in predisposition and SMARCB1 in tumor development.  However, I've assigned a low confidence to this answer because the context provided is limited, and there could potentially be interactions between these proteins that are not mentioned in this specific excerpt. To make a more definitive statement, more comprehensive information about these proteins and their roles in RMC would be needed.
455341 2A2733890 2A2871385	p85	c-src	[INST]Context: [PMID: 9178760 Intracellular signaling of the Ufo/Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is mediated mainly by a multi-substrate docking-site. Ufo/Axl belongs to a new family of receptor tyrosine kinases with an extracellular structure similar to that of neural cell adhesion molecules. In order to elucidate intracellular signaling, the cytoplasmic moiety of Ufo/Axl was used to screen an expression library according to the cloning of receptor targets method. Three putative Ufo substrates were identified: phospholipase Cgamma1, as well as p85alpha and p85beta subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase . Subsequently, chimeric EGFR/Ufo receptors consisting of the extracellular domains of the epidermal growth factor receptor and the transmembrane and intracellular moiety of Ufo were engineered. Using different far-Western blot analyses and coimmunoprecipitation assays, receptor binding of phospholipase cgamma1 and p85 proteins as well as GRB2, c-src and lck was examined in vitro and in vivo. Competitive inhibition of substrate binding and mutagenesis experiments with EGFR/Ufo constructs revealed C-terminal tyrosine 821 (EILpYVNMDEG) as a docking site for multiple effectors, namely phospholipase cgamma1, p85 proteins, GRB2, c-src and lck. Tyrosine 779 (DGLpYALMSRC) demonstrated an additional, but lower binding affinity for the p85 proteins in vitro. In addition, binding of phospholipase cgamma1 occurred through tyrosine 866 (AGRpYVLCPST). Moreover, our in vivo data indicate that further direct or indirect binding sites for phospholipase cgamma1, GRB2, c-src and lck on the human Ufo receptor may exist.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [p85 protein] and [c-src protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Based on the provided context, there is no direct evidence of interaction between the p85 protein and the c-src protein. The passage describes both proteins as binding to the same docking site on the Ufo/Axl receptor (tyrosine 821), but it does not indicate any direct interaction between p85 and c-src themselves.  The text states: "Competitive inhibition of substrate binding and mutagenesis experiments with EGFR/Ufo constructs revealed C-terminal tyrosine 821 (EILpYVNMDEG) as a docking site for multiple effectors, namely phospholipase cgamma1, p85 proteins, GRB2, c-src and lck."  This suggests that p85 and c-src proteins both interact with the same region of the Ufo/Axl receptor, but it does not provide information about any interaction between p85 and c-src directly. They are presented as separate effectors that bind to the same site on the receptor.  The confidence is rated as medium because while there is no evidence of direct interaction, the possibility of indirect interaction through their common binding site cannot be completely ruled out based solely on the information provided in this context.
474004 2A2840941 2A2613339	S6 ribosomal protein	ERG	[INST]Context: [PMID: 22674438 An immunohistochemical signature comprising PTEN, MYC, and ki-67 predicts progression in prostate cancer patients receiving adjuvant docetaxel after prostatectomy. BACKGROUND: Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN is common in prostate cancer and may have prognostic significance. The authors examined PTEN and additional protein markers in primary tumors from patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer who received adjuvant docetaxel in a prospective multicenter trial . METHODS: Fifty-six of 77 patients enrolled in trial had primary prostatectomy specimens available for immunohistochemical analysis of PTEN, MYC, ERG, tumor protein p53 (p53), antigen KI-67, and phosphorylated forms of Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin, and S6 ribosomal protein. Protocol-defined progression included a prostate-specific antigen level ___ 0.4 ng/mL, radiologic/clinical recurrence, or death. Univariate and multivariable proportional hazards regression analyses were used to investigate the influence of PTEN status (and other protein markers) on progression-free survival . RESULTS: In this exploratory, post hoc analysis, PTEN protein loss (vs presence) was observed in 61% of patients and was associated with lower preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels, higher clinical stage, lower ki-67 expression, the presence of p53, and the presence of ERG. In univariate analysis, the factors associated with progression-free survival included Gleason sum, seminal vesicle invasion, PTEN status, MYC expression, and ki-67 expression. In multivariable analysis, only 3 variables emerged as independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival: PTEN status (P = .035), MYC expression (P = .001), and ki-67 expression (P < .001). A prognostic model was constructed that incorporated clinical covariates as well as information on PTEN, MYC, and ki-67. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that PTEN status, MYC expression, and ki-67 expression in primary tumor samples may predict progression-free survival more accurately than clinical factors alone in men with high-risk prostate cancer who receive adjuvant docetaxel after prostatectomy.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [S6 ribosomal protein protein] and [ERG protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting.

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between S6 ribosomal protein and ERG protein. The passage mentions both proteins as part of a list of markers that were analyzed in the study, but it does not describe any relationship or interaction between them.   The text states that ERG presence was associated with PTEN protein loss, but it does not indicate any connection between ERG and S6 ribosomal protein. Similarly, while phosphorylated forms of S6 ribosomal protein were analyzed, the results of this analysis are not discussed in the given context, and no interaction with ERG is mentioned.  Given the lack of information about any relationship between these two proteins in the provided text, we cannot conclude that they interact. However, the confidence is low because the absence of evidence for interaction in this specific context does not necessarily mean that these proteins do not interact in other contexts or that such an interaction has not been discovered in other studies.
15935 2A2575585 2A2454391	HAP1	CTSB	[INST]Context: [PMID: 35459137 BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have implicated autophagy in the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma. This investigation aimed to establish an autophagy-related gene model and nomogram that can help predict the overall survival of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma . METHODS: Clinical characteristics and RNA-seq expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were used in the study. We also downloaded autophagy-related genes from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis website and the Human Autophagy Database. First, we assigned patients into training and testing groups. Finally, a nomogram was constructed for clinical application in evaluating the patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. RESULTS: Overall, we identified 54 differentially expressed autophagy-related genes in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. A new gene risk model based on 7-autophagy-related genes (CDKN2A, FGF7, CTSB, HAP1, DAPK2, DNAJB1, and ITPR1) was developed in the training group and validated in the testing group. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the model could independently predict the prognosis of patients with THCA.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence  Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of an interaction between HAP1 protein and CTSB protein. The context only lists these as two of the seven autophagy-related genes (ARGs) that were used to develop a prognostic risk model for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. While they are part of the same model, this does not necessarily imply a direct interaction between these specific proteins.  The low confidence is due to the limited information provided about the relationships between these genes in the context. It's possible that these proteins do interact in some way related to autophagy or thyroid cancer, but such an interaction is not described or suggested in the given information. To determine if there is an interaction between HAP1 and CTSB proteins, additional research focused specifically on these two proteins would be necessary.

PURPOSE: To compare the protein profiles of tears from normal volunteers and patients with conjunctivochalasis (CCH), with a view to identifying proteins whose expression is altered in this pathology. METHODS: Tears from 8 normal subjects and 6 patients with CCH were analyzed by 2-dimensional electrophoresis. Twenty-four spots were significantly upregulated in CCH compared with that in controls. Eleven protein spots were identified, which included proteins belonging to the S100 family (A8, A9, A4; 2.44, 1.71, and 2.82 fold upregulation, respectively), guanosine triphosphate-binding protein 2 (1.95 fold), l-lactate dehydrogenase A-like 6B (2.32 fold), fatty acid-binding protein (2.01 fold), keratin type I cytoskeletal 10 (1.81 fold), glutathione S-transferase P (2.27 fold), peroxiredoxin-1, peroxiredoxin-5 (1.79- and 1.92 fold, respectively), and cullin-4B+ glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1.96 fold). CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a group of proteins, which is upregulated in CCH tears. Although some of them, such as S100A4, S100A8, and peroxiredoxin-5, are markers of inflammation and oxidative processes, monitoring their levels in CCH might be useful for assessing the severity and progression of the disease.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein] and [fatty acid-binding protein protein] interact with each other?

Explanation: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any interaction between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein and fatty acid-binding protein. The study focuses on comparing tear protein profiles between normal subjects and patients with conjunctivochalasis (CCH). Both proteins are mentioned as being upregulated in CCH tears, but there is no information about their direct interaction or functional relationship.  The context simply lists these proteins among others that were found to be upregulated in CCH tears:  1. Fatty acid-binding protein (2.01 fold upregulation) 2. Cullin-4B+ glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1.96 fold upregulation)  While both proteins are part of the group that shows increased expression in CCH, this does not necessarily imply an interaction between them. The study does not provide any information about potential biochemical or functional interactions between these specific proteins.  The confidence is low because while there's no evidence of interaction in the given context, the possibility of an interaction cannot be completely ruled out based solely on this limited information.
344903 2A2712282 2A2450692	PDE10A	CA2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 27339393 Phosphodiesterase 11A, Enriched in Ventral Hippocampus Neurons, is Required for Consolidation of Social but not Nonsocial Memories in Mice. CAMP signaling in the ventral hippocampal formation (VHIPP) appears to be required for social memory formation, but the phosphodiesterase involved remains unknown. Previously, we showed that phosphodiesterase 11a, which degrades cAMP and cGMP, is preferentially expressed in CA1 and subiculum of the VHIPP. Here, we determine whether phosphodiesterase 11a is expressed in neurons where it could directly influence synaptic plasticity and whether expression is required for the consolidation and/or retrieval of social memories. In CA1, and possibly CA2, PDE11A4 is expressed throughout neuronal cell bodies, dendrites (stratum radiatum), and axons (fimbria), but not astrocytes. Unlike PDE2A, PDE9A, or PDE10A, PDE11A4 expression begins very low at postnatal day 7 (P7) and dramatically increases until P28, at which time it stabilizes to young adult levels. This expression pattern is consistent with the fact that phosphodiesterase 11a is required for social long-term memory formation during adolescence and adulthood. Male and female PDE11 knockout mice show normal short-term memory for social odor recognition and social transmission of food preference, but no long-term memory 24___h post training. Importantly, phosphodiesterase 11a knockout mice show normal long-term memory for nonsocial odor recognition. Deletion of phosphodiesterase 11a may impair memory consolidation by impairing requisite protein translation in the VHIPP. Relative to WT littermates, phosphodiesterase 11a knockout mice show reduced expression of RSK2 and lowered phosphorylation of S6 . Together, these data suggest phosphodiesterase 11a is selectively required for the proper consolidation of recognition and associative social memories.

The context mentions PDE10A briefly as part of a comparison of expression patterns with PDE11A4, but it does not discuss any direct interaction with CA2 protein.   The passage does mention that PDE11A4 is expressed in CA1 and "possibly CA2" neuronal regions, but this doesn't constitute an interaction between PDE10A and CA2 proteins.   Given the limited information provided about these specific proteins and their potential interactions, I cannot confidently state that they interact. However, since the context doesn't explicitly rule out an interaction either, I've assigned a low confidence to this assessment.
113028 2A2763771 2A2516455	RAMP3	endothelin-1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 27382803 [Adrenomedullin in the kidney: physiology and pathophysiology]. Adrenomedullin is a potent vasodilatory 52-aminoacid peptide hormone, ubiquitous with multiple physiological effects which contribute to homeostatic responses. The biological effects of adrenomedullin are directly mediated by specific receptors as heterodimers composed of the calcitonin-receptor-like receptor and one of two receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMP2 or RAMP3). The CLR/RAMP2 (AM1 receptor) is more highly AM-specific than The CLR/RAMP3 (AM2 receptor). Plasma levels of adrenomedullin are elevated proportionately to the increase in blood pressure and degree of renal damage in patients with hypertension; Likewise, these levels are correlated with the degree ofheart and arterial hypertrophy. Adrenomedullin has renal vasodilatory, natriuretic and diuretic actions; Increased glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow. Adrenomedullin inhibits proliferation and reactive oxygen species generation in mesangial cells; Also inhibits aldosterone secretion in the zona glomerulosa and endothelin-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells. Therefore, it is proposed as a new marker in various diseases, especially chronic renal failure. This disease presents compensatory hypertrophy of the glomeruli and mesangial proliferation, administration of adrenomedullin reduces the levels of proteinuria, suggesting that adrenomedullin has an important modulator role in blood pressure and could be a therapeutic option for chronic renal failure.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [RAMP3 protein] and [endothelin-1 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, low confidence.  Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of an interaction between RAMP3 protein and endothelin-1 protein. The text discusses these proteins separately in different contexts:  1. RAMP3 is mentioned as part of the AM2 receptor (CLR/RAMP3) for adrenomedullin.  2. Endothelin-1 is mentioned in the context of being inhibited by adrenomedullin in vascular smooth muscle cells.  While both proteins are discussed in relation to adrenomedullin, there is no information provided about any direct interaction between RAMP3 and endothelin-1. However, given the limited information in the context and the complex nature of biological systems, it's possible that there could be some indirect relationship or interaction that is not mentioned here. This is why I've assigned a low confidence to this assessment.
