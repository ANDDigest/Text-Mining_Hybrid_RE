HPRD50.d1 HPRD50.d1.s3.e0 HPRD50.d1.s3.e1	MCP-1	CCR2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 10529171 Identification of residues in the monocyte chemotactic protein-1 that contact the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2. The CC chemokine, MCP-1, has been identified as a major chemoattractant for T cells and monocytes, and plays a significant role in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. To identify the regions of MCP-1 that contact its receptor, CCR2, we substituted all surface-exposed residues with alanine. Some residues were also mutated to other amino acids to identify the importance of charge, hydrophobicity, or aromaticity at specific positions. The binding affinity of each mutant for CCR2 was assayed with THP-1 and CCR2-transfected CHL cells. The majority of point mutations had no effect. Residues at the N-terminus of the protein, known to be crucial for signaling, contribute less than a factor of 10 to the binding affinity. However, two clusters of primarily basic residues (R24, K35, K38, K49, and Y13), separated by a 35 A hydrophobic groove, reduced the level of binding by 15-100-fold. A peptide fragment encompassing residues 13-35 recapitulated some of the mutational data derived from the intact protein. It exhibited modest binding as a linear peptide and dramatically improved affinity when the region which adopts a single turn of a 3(10)-helix in the protein, which includes R24, was constrained by a disulfide bond. Additional constraints at the ends of the peptide, corresponding to the disulfide between the first and third cysteines in MCP-1, yielded further improvements in affinity. Together, these data suggest a model in which a large surface area of MCP-1 contacts the receptor, and the accumulation of a number of weak interactions results in the 35 pM affinity observed for the wild-type (WT) protein. The receptor binding site of MCP-1 also is significantly different from the binding sites of RANTES and IL-8, providing insight into the issue of receptor specificity. It was previously shown that the N-terminus of CCR2 is critical for binding MCP-1 [Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19084-92; Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 23186-90]. Point mutations of six acidic residues in this region of the receptor were made to test their role in ligand binding. This identified D25 and D27 of the DYDY motif as being important. On the basis of our data, we propose a model in which the receptor N-terminus lies along the hydrophobic groove in an extended fashion, placing the DYDY motif near the basic cluster involving R24 and K49 of MCP-1. This in turn orients the signaling residues (Y13 and the N-terminus) for productive interaction with the receptor.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [MCP-1 protein] and [CCR2 protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal. Instead, they are presented as separate agents that stabilize HIF-1alpha and have effects on the induction of EBV reactivation." [NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence.  ** Explanation:** The context discusses experiments aimed at identifying the regions of the MCP-1 protein that contact its receptor, the CCR2 protein. The authors mention that mutations in MCP-1 affect its binding affinity to CCR2, indicating a direct interaction. They propose a model where "a large surface area of MCP-1 contacts the receptor," and specific residues in both MCP-1 and CCR2 are important for this interaction. This evidence strongly supports that the MCP-1 protein and the CCR2 protein interact with each other.

BACKGROUND: A number of recent studies have identified interleukin (IL)-6 as an important regulator of prostate cancer growth. Here, we investigate the potential interaction of IL-6 with phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase, a key growth regulatory enzyme, in prostate cancer cell lines. METHODS: Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase, in the human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 was assessed by sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-p85 antibody and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. The effects of wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI-3 kinase, and/or IL-6 on cell growth were assessed by MTT assays. DNA laddering experiments were performed to assay for programmed cell death. RESULTS: Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 is upregulated by IL-6 in both LNCaP and PC-3. IL-6 promotes coprecipitation of p85 with gp130, the signal-transducing component of the IL-6 receptor. Inhibition of PI-3 kinase with wortmannin induces programmed cell death in PC-3 cells. In contrast, wortmannin has no effect on LNCaP growth when used alone; however, combined with IL-6, wortmannin promotes apoptosis in these cells. CONCLUSIONS: PI-3 kinase is involved in IL-6 signal transduction and delivers an antiapoptotic signal in human prostate cancer cell lines.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Interleukin-6 protein] and [phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence  ** Explanation:** The provided context describes a study investigating the interaction between Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) in human prostate cancer cell lines. The results indicate that IL-6 activates PI-3 kinase through several mechanisms:  1. **Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PI-3 Kinase Subunit:** IL-6 upregulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase, in both LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. This phosphorylation is a key step in activating PI-3 kinase signaling pathways.  2. **Coprecipitation with gp130:** IL-6 promotes the coprecipitation of p85 with gp130, the signal-transducing component of the IL-6 receptor complex. This suggests a direct or closely associated interaction where PI-3 kinase is recruited to the activated IL-6 receptor complex.  3. **Involvement in IL-6 Signal Transduction:** The study concludes that PI-3 kinase is involved in IL-6 signal transduction, delivering an antiapoptotic signal that influences cell survival in prostate cancer cells.  These findings demonstrate a biochemical interaction between IL-6 protein and PI-3 kinase protein, where IL-6 activates PI-3 kinase signaling pathways that affect cellular functions such as apoptosis. Therefore, based on the evidence presented, the two proteins interact with each other.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence.  ** Explanation:** In the provided context, it is stated that "IL-6 promotes coprecipitation of p85 with gp130, the signal-transducing component of the IL-6 receptor." This indicates that IL-6 interacts with gp130 as part of its signaling mechanism. Since gp130 is a component of the IL-6 receptor complex, IL-6 binding to its receptor involves direct interaction with gp130 to initiate signal transduction. Therefore, the IL-6 protein and gp130 protein interact with each other in the described study.

Intracellular signaling pathways, which regulate the interactions of integrins with their ligands, affect a wide variety of biological functions. Here we provide evidence of how cytohesin-1, an integrin-binding protein and guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF GTPases, regulates cell adhesion. Mutational analyses of the beta-2 cytoplasmic domain revealed that the adhesive function of LFA-1 depends on its interaction with cytohesin-1, unless the integrin is activated by exogenous divalent cations. Secondly, cytohesin-1 induces expression of an extracellular activation epitope of LFA-1, and the exchange factor function is not essential for this activity. In contrast, LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 is strongly inhibited by a cytohesin-1 mutant, which fails to catalyze ARF GDP-GTP exchange in vitro. Thus, cytohesin-1 is involved in the activation of LFA-1, most probably through direct interaction with the integrin, and induces cell spreading by its ARF-GEF activity.

Intracellular signaling pathways, which regulate the interactions of integrins with their ligands, affect a wide variety of biological functions. Here we provide evidence of how cytohesin-1, an integrin-binding protein and guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF GTPases, regulates cell adhesion. Mutational analyses of the beta-2 cytoplasmic domain revealed that the adhesive function of LFA-1 depends on its interaction with cytohesin-1, unless the integrin is activated by exogenous divalent cations. Secondly, cytohesin-1 induces expression of an extracellular activation epitope of LFA-1, and the exchange factor function is not essential for this activity. In contrast, LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 is strongly inhibited by a cytohesin-1 mutant, which fails to catalyze ARF GDP-GTP exchange in vitro. Thus, cytohesin-1 is involved in the activation of LFA-1, most probably through direct interaction with the integrin, and induces cell spreading by its ARF-GEF activity. We therefore propose that both direct regulation of the integrin and concomitant changes in the membrane topology of adherent T cells are modulated by dissectable functions of cytohesin-1.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [cytohesin-1 protein] and [ARF protein] interact with each other?

We have studied the transcription regulation of the rat thromboxane synthase (TXS) gene by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in macrophages. The transcription activity of a cloned 5'-flanking region (1.6 kilobases) of the rat TXS gene (5'FL-TXS) was examined by luciferase reporter gene assay. TXS mRNA expression and the transcription activity of 5'FL-TXS were inhibited by PPARgamma ligands, 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (PGJ(2)), and the thiazolidinedione troglitazone (TRO) in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of PPARgamma also significantly suppressed transcription, and further addition of PGJ(2) or TRO augmented the suppression. Deletion analysis showed that the element responsible for the PPARgamma effect is located in a region containing the nuclear factor E2 (NF-E2)/AP-1 site (-98/-88), which was indicated to be the major promoter of the TXS gene. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the NF-E2/AP-1 site and nuclear extracts from macrophages, we observed a specific protein-DNA complex formation, which was inhibited by a specific antibody against the transcription factor NRF2 (NF-E2-related factor 2). Moreover, the complex was decreased with PGJ(2), TRO, or in vitro translated PPARgamma. The transcription suppression by PPARgamma was confirmed using this truncated NRF2-binding element (-98/-88) by the reporter gene assay. Finally, a direct interaction between PPARgamma and NRF2 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay. In conclusion, the NRF2-binding site (-98/-88) is the major promoter of 5'FL-TXS which can be suppressed by activated PPARgamma via a protein-protein interaction with NRF2 in macrophages.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma protein] and [NRF2 protein] interact with each other?

ADAM 12, a member of the ADAM family of transmembrane metalloprotease-disintegrins, has been implicated previously in the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts. In the present study, we show that the cytoplasmic tail of mouse ADAM 12 interacts in vitro and in vivo with the Src homology 3 domain of the p85alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified three p85alpha-binding sites in ADAM 12 involving PXXP motifs located at amino acids 825-828, 833-836, and 884-887. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-pleckstrin homology (PH) domain fusion protein as a probe for PI 3-kinase lipid products, we have further demonstrated that expression of ADAM 12 in C2C12 cells resulted in translocation of GFP-PH to the plasma membrane. This suggests that transmembrane ADAM 12, by providing docking sites for the Src homology 3 domain of p85alpha, activates PI 3-kinase by mediating its recruitment to the membrane.

The text states:  *“Overexpression of CLIP-170 results in a zinc finger-dependent localization of a phospho-LIS1 isoform and dynactin to MT bundles, raising the possibility that CLIP-170 and LIS1 regulate dynein/dynactin binding to MTs.”*  This indicates a direct interaction between CLIP-170 and the phosphorylated form of LIS1, supporting the conclusion that these two proteins interact with each other.

CLIP-170 is a plus-end tracking protein which may act as an anticatastrophe factor. It has been proposed to mediate the association of dynein/dynactin to microtubule (MT) plus ends, and it also binds to kinetochores in a dynein/dynactin-dependent fashion, both via its C-terminal domain. This domain contains two zinc finger motifs (proximal and distal), which are hypothesized to mediate protein-protein interactions. LIS1, a protein implicated in brain development, acts in several processes mediated by the dynein/dynactin pathway by interacting with dynein and other proteins. Here we demonstrate colocalization and direct interaction between CLIP-170 and LIS1. In mammalian cells, LIS1 recruitment to kinetochores is dynein/dynactin dependent, and recruitment there of CLIP-170 is dependent on its site of binding to LIS1, located in the distal zinc finger motif. Overexpression of CLIP-170 results in a zinc finger-dependent localization of a phospho-LIS1 isoform and dynactin to MT bundles, raising the possibility that CLIP-170 and LIS1 regulate dynein/dynactin binding to MTs.

The receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase DEP1, also known as CD148, is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells, in a variety of tumor cell lines, and in lymphocytes. Expression of DEP1 is enhanced at high cell density, and this observation suggests that DEP1 may function in the regulation of cell adhesion and possibly contact inhibition of cell growth. In order to investigate the function of DEP1, substrate-trapping mutants of the phosphatase were used to identify potential substrates. GST-fusion proteins containing the DEP1 catalytic domain with a substrate-trapping D/A mutation were found to interact with p120(ctn), a component of adherens junctions. DEP1 also interacted with other members of the catenin gene family including beta-catenin and gamma-catenin. The interaction with p120(ctn) is likely to be direct, as the interaction occurs in K562 cells lacking functional adherens junctions and E-cadherin expression. Catalytic domains of the tyrosine phosphatases PTP-PEST, CD45, and PTPbeta did not interact with proteins of the catenin family to detectable levels, suggesting that the interaction of DEP1 with these proteins is specific. DEP1 expression was concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact in A549 cells. p120(ctn) was found to colocalize with these structures. Together these data suggest an important role for DEP-1 in the function of cell-cell contacts and adherens junctions.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [DEP1 protein] and [p120(ctn) protein] interact with each other?

Ribosome biogenesis requires a vast number of trans-acting factors many of which are required for the chemical modification and processing of the pre-rRNA component. The U3 snoRNP complex is required for the early cleavage steps in pre-rRNA processing. We have cloned cDNAs encoding the human and mouse homologs of the yeast U3 snoRNP-associated proteins Imp3 and Imp4. Both human proteins localize to nucleoli and interact with the U3 snoRNA. The results of complementation experiments show that, in contrast to mouse Imp4, mouse Imp3 can partially alleviate the growth defect of the corresponding yeast null strain, indicating that the role of Imp3 in pre-rRNA processing is evolutionarily conserved. The results of density gradient centrifugation experiments show that, in contrast to hU3-55K, the human Imp3 and Imp4 proteins predominantly interact with the U3 snoRNA in 60-80S ribonucleoprotein complexes. In addition, we have found that hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 can form a stable hetero-trimeric complex in vitro, which is generated by direct interactions of both hImp3 and hImp4 with hMpp10. The analysis of hImp3 and hImp4 mutants indicated that their binding to hMpp10 correlates with their nucleolar accumulation, strongly suggesting that the formation of the ternary complex of hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 is required for their association with nucleolar components.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Imp3 protein] and [Imp4 protein] interact with each other?

The text states that "hImp3, hImp4, and hMpp10 can form a stable hetero-trimeric complex in vitro, which is generated by direct interactions of both hImp3 and hImp4 with hMpp10." This indicates that both hImp3 and hImp4 interact directly with hMpp10 but not necessarily with each other. The formation of the ternary complex relies on their individual interactions with hMpp10 rather than a direct interaction between hImp3 and hImp4. Therefore, based on the information provided, Imp3 and Imp4 proteins do not interact directly with each other.

In the present study, we observed evidence of cross-talk between the cannabinoid receptor CB1 and the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) using a heterologous system. When the two receptors are co-expressed, we observed a major CB1-dependent enhancement of the orexin A potency to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway; dose-responses curves indicated a 100-fold increase in the potency of orexin-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. This effect required a functional CB1 receptor as evidenced by the blockade of the orexin response by the specific CB1 antagonist, N-(piperidino-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716), but also by pertussis toxin, suggesting that this potentiation is Gi-mediated. In contrast to OX1R, the potency of direct activation of CB1 was not affected by co-expression with OX1R. In addition, electron microscopy experiments revealed that CB1 and OX1R are closely apposed at the plasma membrane level; they are close enough to form hetero-oligomers. Altogether, for the first time our data provide evidence that CB1 is able to potentiate an orexigenic receptor. Considering the antiobesity effect of SR141716, these results open new avenues to understand the mechanism by which the molecule may prevent weight gain through functional interaction between CB1 and other receptors involved in the control of appetite.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CB1 protein] and [orexin 1 receptor protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence.  ** Explanation:** The provided context from the study (PMID: 12690115) presents clear evidence of interaction between the CB1 receptor protein and the orexin 1 receptor protein (OX1R). Key points indicating their interaction include:  1. **Cross-talk Between Receptors:** The study observed evidence of cross-talk between CB1 and OX1R when co-expressed in a heterologous system. This cross-talk is manifested as a CB1-dependent enhancement of orexin A's ability to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.  2. **Potentiation of Orexin Response:** There was a notable 100-fold increase in the potency of orexin-mediated MAPK activation due to the presence of CB1. This potentiation required functional CB1 receptors, as it was blocked by a specific CB1 antagonist (SR141716) and pertussis toxin, suggesting that the interaction is Gi-mediated.  3. **Physical Proximity and Potential Hetero-oligomerization:** Electron microscopy experiments revealed that CB1 and OX1R are closely apposed at the plasma membrane level, close enough to form hetero-oligomers. This suggests a direct physical interaction between the two proteins.  4. **Selective Effect:** While the presence of CB1 enhanced the activity of OX1R, the potency of direct activation of CB1 was not affected by co-expression with OX1R. This implies a unidirectional modulation where CB1 specifically influences OX1R function.  5. **Functional Implications:** The interaction between CB1 and OX1R has physiological relevance, particularly in understanding mechanisms controlling appetite and weight gain, highlighting the significance of their interaction.  Based on these findings, there is strong evidence to conclude that the CB1 protein and orexin 1 receptor protein interact with each other.

This effect required a functional CB1 receptor as evidenced by the blockade of the orexin response by the specific CB1 antagonist, N-(piperidino-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716), but also by pertussis toxin, suggesting that this potentiation is Gi-mediated. In contrast to OX1R, the potency of direct activation of CB1 was not affected by co-expression with OX1R. In addition, electron microscopy experiments revealed that CB1 and OX1R are closely apposed at the plasma membrane level; they are close enough to form hetero-oligomers. Altogether, for the first time our data provide evidence that CB1 is able to potentiate an orexigenic receptor. Considering the antiobesity effect of SR141716, these results open new avenues to understand the mechanism by which the molecule may prevent weight gain through functional interaction between CB1 and other receptors involved in the control of appetite.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CB1 protein] and [OX1R protein] interact with each other?

The study observed cross-talk between the cannabinoid receptor CB1 and the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) when co-expressed. There was a significant CB1-dependent enhancement of orexin A potency to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, indicating functional interaction. Additionally, electron microscopy experiments showed that CB1 and OX1R are closely apposed at the plasma membrane level and are close enough to form hetero-oligomers, suggesting a direct physical interaction between the two proteins.

Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Crk. To identify new binding partners for GAB proteins and better understand their functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with hGab2-(120-587) as bait. This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases. The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned CdGAP and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro. The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42. GC-GAP is predominantly expressed in the brain with low levels detected in other tissues. Antibodies directed against GC-GAP recognized a protein of approximately 200 kDa. Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA. Suppression of GC-GAP expression by siRNA inhibited proliferation of C6 astroglioma cells. In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro. We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities. Given that GC-GAP is specifically expressed in the nervous system and that it is localized to the dendritic processes of cultured neurons, GC-GAP may play a role in dendritic morphogenesis and also possibly in neural/glial cell proliferation.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GC-GAP protein] and [Gab1 protein] interact with each other?

This indicates a direct interaction between the GC-GAP protein and the Nck protein. The interaction is supported by experimental evidence showing that GC-GAP binds to Nck through its proline-rich motifs, which are known to interact with SH3 domains like those found in Nck. Therefore, based on the information given, we can confidently conclude that GC-GAP and Nck proteins interact with each other.

Gab1 and Gab2 are scaffolding proteins acting downstream of cell surface receptors and interact with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as Grb2, Shp-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, and Crk. To identify new binding partners for GAB proteins and better understand their functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with hGab2-(120-587) as bait. This work led to identification of a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases. The GAP domain shows high similarity to the recently cloned CdGAP and displays activity toward RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro. The protein was named GC-GAP for its ability to interact with GAB proteins and its activity toward Rac and Cdc42. GC-GAP is predominantly expressed in the brain with low levels detected in other tissues. Antibodies directed against GC-GAP recognized a protein of approximately 200 kDa. Expression of GC-GAP in 293T cells led to a reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels but not RhoA. Suppression of GC-GAP expression by siRNA inhibited proliferation of C6 astroglioma cells. In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro. We propose that Gab1 and Gab2 in cooperation with other adapter molecules might regulate the cellular localization of GC-GAP under specific stimuli, acting to regulate precisely Rac and Cdc42 activities.

Downregulation of NudC by RNA interference results in multiple mitotic defects, including multinucleation and cells arrested at the midbody stage, which are rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type NudC, but not by NudC with mutations in the Plk1 phosphorylation sites. These results suggest that Plk1 phosphorylation of NudC may influence cytokinesis.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [NudC protein] and [Plk1 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence  ** Explanation:** The provided context clearly indicates that the NudC protein and the Plk1 protein interact with each other. Specifically:  - **Identification of Interaction:** The abstract states that NudC was identified as a **Plk1 binding protein** through a cDNA phage display screen using Plk1 C-terminal affinity columns. This suggests a direct physical interaction between the two proteins.  - **Phosphorylation Activity:** It is mentioned that Plk1 **phosphorylates NudC** at conserved serine residues S274 and S326 in vitro, and there is evidence that NudC is also a substrate for Plk1 in vivo. Phosphorylation is a post-translational modification where one protein (kinase) adds a phosphate group to another protein, indicating a biochemical interaction.  - **Functional Impact:** The phosphorylation of NudC by Plk1 is suggested to influence cytokinesis, as alterations in NudC phosphorylation sites affect the rescue of mitotic defects caused by NudC downregulation.  These points demonstrate a direct and functional interaction between the NudC protein and the Plk1 protein, supporting a **high confidence** in this conclusion.

Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) plays essential roles at multiple events during cell division, yet little is known about its physiological substrates. In a cDNA phage display screen using Plk1 C-terminal affinity columns, we identified NudC (nuclear distribution gene C) as a Plk1 binding protein.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence.  ** Explanation:**  Based on the provided context, Plk1 protein directly interacts with NudC protein. The text states that NudC was identified as a "Plk1 binding protein" through a cDNA phage display screen using Plk1 C-terminal affinity columns, indicating physical binding between Plk1 and NudC. Furthermore, it is mentioned that "Plk1 phosphorylates NudC at conserved S274 and S326 residues in vitro," and there is evidence that "NudC is also a substrate for Plk1 in vivo." The phosphorylation of NudC by Plk1 is functionally significant, as downregulation of NudC leads to mitotic defects that are rescued by the expression of wild-type NudC but not by NudC mutants lacking Plk1 phosphorylation sites. This suggests that the interaction between Plk1 and NudC, specifically through phosphorylation, plays a crucial role in cytokinesis. Therefore, the terms Plk1 protein and NudC protein interact with each other in the context provided.
HPRD50.d24 HPRD50.d24.s1.e2 HPRD50.d24.s1.e3	oncostatin M	LDLR	[INST]Context: [PMID: 12947119 Specific interaction of Egr1 and c/EBPbeta leads to the transcriptional activation of the human low density lipoprotein receptor gene. The sterol-independent regulatory element (SIRE) of the LDL receptor (LDLR) promoter mediates oncostatin M (OM)-induced transcription of the LDLR gene through a cholesterol-independent pathway. Our prior studies have detected specific associations of the zinc finger transcription factor Egr1 with the SIRE sequence in OM-stimulated HepG2 cells. Because the SIRE motif is composed of a c/EBP binding site and a cAMP response element, both of which are quite divergent from the classical GC-rich Egr1 recognition sequences, we hypothesized that Egr1 may regulate LDLR transcription through interacting with members of the c/EBP and CREB families. Here, we show that treating HepG2 cells with OM specifically leads to prominent increases of the levels of c/EBPbeta and Egr1 bound to the LDLR promoter in vivo. In vitro, the binding of Egr1 to the SIRE sequence is weak, but is strikingly enhanced in the presence of HepG2 nuclear extract. Mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrate that the N-terminal transactivation domain of Egr1 specifically interacts with c/EBPbeta but not with c/EBPalpha or CREB. The OM treatment further enhances this interaction, resulting in a large increase in the Egr1 transactivating activity. The direct protein to protein contact between Egr1 and c/EBPbeta is also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, we show that a mutation of the phosphorylation motif of c/EBPbeta diminished the OM-stimulated interaction of Egr1 and c/EBPbeta. Taken together, we provide strong evidence that Egr1 regulates LDLR transcription via a novel mechanism of protein-protein interaction with c/EBPbeta.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [oncostatin M protein] and [LDLR protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high).

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, high confidence;  Explanation: In the provided context, oncostatin M (OM) is described as a cytokine that induces the transcription of the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene through a cholesterol-independent pathway involving the sterol-independent regulatory element (SIRE) of the LDLR promoter. The treatment of HepG2 cells with OM leads to increased levels of transcription factors (such as Egr1 and c/EBPβ) bound to the LDLR promoter, thereby enhancing LDLR gene expression. However, there is no mention of a direct interaction between the oncostatin M protein and the LDLR protein itself. Instead, OM acts upstream by stimulating signaling pathways that result in increased LDLR gene transcription. Therefore, based on the provided context, the oncostatin M protein and LDLR protein do not directly interact with each other.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, medium confidence.  ** Explanation:**  According to the provided context, "TBP-1 associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and Hif1 alpha in vivo." This suggests that TBP-1 protein forms a complex that includes both pVHL and Hif1 alpha proteins. Additionally, it is mentioned that "overexpression of TBP-1 promotes degradation of Hif1 alpha in a pVHL-dependent manner," and that blocking TBP-1 expression "causes prolonged degradation kinetics of Hif1 alpha." These observations imply that TBP-1 interacts with Hif1 alpha within the cellular environment, likely facilitating its degradation through the proteasome pathway. While the interaction may be indirect and mediated by pVHL, the formation of a complex involving TBP-1 and Hif1 alpha indicates that they do interact in the context described.

HPRD50.d27 HPRD50.d27.s0.e0 HPRD50.d27.s0.e2	Pinin	SRp75	[INST]Context: [PMID: 14578391 Pinin/DRS/memA interacts with SRp75, SRm300 and SRrp130 in corneal epithelial cells. PURPOSE: Pinin (Pnn/DRS/memA) is a cell-adhesion-related and nuclear protein that has been identified as central in the establishment and maintenance of corneal epithelial cell-cell adhesion. To begin the elucidation of the role of Pnn within the nucleus of corneal epithelial cells, this study was undertaken to identify the proteins that bind to Pnn. METHODS: Yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed. A human cDNA library in the pGAD-10 vector and C-terminal region of human Pnn (465-717) in a pAS2-1 vector were cotransformed into the PJ69-4A yeast strain, containing the lacZ, HIS3, and ADE2 reporter genes. To dissect domains of Pnn responsible for mediating the interaction with the identified proteins, PNN fragments were ligated with the DNA-binding domain of the pAS2-1 vector. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-T, RCB1384) and HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with mammalian expression vectors containing Pnn with identified interacting partners and subsequently immunostained and immunoblotted to determine expressed and endogenous proteins. RESULTS: Pnn colocalized and copurified with serine-arginine (SR) proteins. Three SR-rich proteins were identified that interact with the C-terminus of Pnn: SRp75 and SRm300, known components of spliceosome machinery, and a novel 130-kDa nuclear protein, SRrp130. All of these proteins colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with one another and exhibited speckled nuclear distribution that aligned with components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. The cDNA for SRrp130 encoded a protein of 805 amino acid residues and contained multiple arginine-serine (RS) repeats but had no RNA recognition motif. Analysis of the Pnn motifs using two-hybrid system assays demonstrated that the polyserine/RS motif within Pnn plays a central but not exclusive role in mediating molecular interactions with identified SR-rich proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Pnn and SR-rich proteins may be part of a multiprotein complex within the nucleus and may be involved in pre-mRNA processing.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Pinin protein] and [SRp75 protein] interact with each other?

This indicates that the Pinin protein directly interacts with the SRp75 protein. Further supporting this interaction, the text mentions that "All of these proteins colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with one another," demonstrating a physical association between Pinin and SRp75 in the cellular environment. The interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid analyses and confirmed using immunostaining and immunoblotting techniques in human corneal epithelial and HEK-293 cells.

PURPOSE: Pinin (Pnn/DRS/memA) is a cell-adhesion-related and nuclear protein that has been identified as central in the establishment and maintenance of corneal epithelial cell-cell adhesion. To begin the elucidation of the role of Pnn within the nucleus of corneal epithelial cells, this study was undertaken to identify the proteins that bind to Pnn. METHODS: Yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed. A human cDNA library in the pGAD-10 vector and C-terminal region of human Pnn (465-717) in a pAS2-1 vector were cotransformed into the PJ69-4A yeast strain, containing the lacZ, HIS3, and ADE2 reporter genes. To dissect domains of Pnn responsible for mediating the interaction with the identified proteins, PNN fragments were ligated with the DNA-binding domain of the pAS2-1 vector. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-T, RCB1384) and HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with mammalian expression vectors containing Pnn with identified interacting partners and subsequently immunostained and immunoblotted to determine expressed and endogenous proteins. RESULTS: Pnn colocalized and copurified with serine-arginine (SR) proteins. Three SR-rich proteins were identified that interact with the C-terminus of Pnn: SRp75 and SRm300, known components of spliceosome machinery, and a novel 130-kDa nuclear protein, SRrp130. All of these proteins colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with one another and exhibited speckled nuclear distribution that aligned with components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. The cDNA for SRrp130 encoded a protein of 805 amino acid residues and contained multiple arginine-serine (RS) repeats but had no RNA recognition motif. Analysis of the Pnn motifs using two-hybrid system assays demonstrated that the polyserine/RS motif within Pnn plays a central but not exclusive role in mediating molecular interactions with identified SR-rich proteins.

The de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a is one of three mammalian DNA methyltransferases that has been shown to play crucial roles in embryonic development, genomic imprinting and transcriptional silencing. Despite its importance, very little is known about how the enzymatic activity and transcriptional repression functions of Dnmt3a are regulated. Here we show that Dnmt3a interacts with multiple components of the sumoylation machinery, namely the E2 sumo conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and the E3 sumo ligases PIAS1 and PIASxalpha, all of which are involved in conjugating the small ubiquitin-like modifier polypeptide, SUMO-1, to its target proteins. Dnmt3a is modified by SUMO-1 in vivo and in vitro and the region of Dnmt3a responsible for interaction maps to the N-terminal regulatory domain. Functionally, sumoylation of Dnmt3a disrupts its ability to interact with histone deacetylases (HDAC1/2), but not with another interaction partner, Dnmt3b.

This indicates a direct interaction between the **Dnmt3a protein** and the **SUMO-1 protein** through the process of sumoylation. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification where the SUMO-1 protein is covalently attached to target proteins like Dnmt3a. This modification affects Dnmt3a's ability to interact with other proteins (e.g., histone deacetylases HDAC1/2) and alters its capacity to repress transcription. Therefore, based on the evidence that SUMO-1 modifies Dnmt3a by direct attachment, it is clear that the two proteins interact.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence.  ** Explanation:** Based on the provided context, Dnmt3a is modified by SUMO-1 both in vivo and in vitro. The text states that "Dnmt3a is modified by SUMO-1 in vivo and in vitro and the region of Dnmt3a responsible for interaction maps to the N-terminal regulatory domain." This indicates that SUMO-1 is covalently attached to Dnmt3a through the process of sumoylation, a post-translational modification where the SUMO-1 protein interacts directly with Dnmt3a. Therefore, the Dnmt3a protein and the SUMO-1 protein interact with each other.
HPRD50.d29 HPRD50.d29.s3.e0 HPRD50.d29.s3.e1	Dnmt3a	HDAC1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 14752048 Modification of de novo DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) by SUMO-1 modulates its interaction with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and its capacity to repress transcription. The de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a is one of three mammalian DNA methyltransferases that has been shown to play crucial roles in embryonic development, genomic imprinting and transcriptional silencing. Despite its importance, very little is known about how the enzymatic activity and transcriptional repression functions of Dnmt3a are regulated. Here we show that Dnmt3a interacts with multiple components of the sumoylation machinery, namely the E2 sumo conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and the E3 sumo ligases PIAS1 and PIASxalpha, all of which are involved in conjugating the small ubiquitin-like modifier polypeptide, SUMO-1, to its target proteins. Dnmt3a is modified by SUMO-1 in vivo and in vitro and the region of Dnmt3a responsible for interaction maps to the N-terminal regulatory domain. Functionally, sumoylation of Dnmt3a disrupts its ability to interact with histone deacetylases (HDAC1/2), but not with another interaction partner, Dnmt3b. Conditions that enhance the sumoylation of Dnmt3a in vivo abolish its capacity to repress transcription. These studies reveal a new level of regulation governing Dnmt3a whereby a post-translational modification can dramatically regulate its interaction with specific protein partners and alter its ability to repress transcription.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Dnmt3a protein] and [HDAC1 protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence.  ** Explanation:** The provided context states that Dnmt3a interacts with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. Specifically, it mentions that "Functionally, sumoylation of Dnmt3a disrupts its ability to interact with histone deacetylases (HDAC1/2)," indicating that under normal (non-sumoylated) conditions, Dnmt3a does interact with HDAC1. This interaction plays a role in Dnmt3a's capacity to repress transcription. Therefore, based on the information given, Dnmt3a protein and HDAC1 protein do interact with each other.

Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of perlecan, a specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan, to the beta-amyloid protein (A beta)-containing amyloid deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. In the present investigation, the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell (EC)- and smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived PGs to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits may be due to its interactions with perlecan. Pretreatment of AA amyloidotic splenic and liver tissue sections with synthetic A beta (1-28) produced strong immunoreactivity with A beta antibodies at tissue sites enriched in perlecan which was partially removed by pretreatment with heparitinase, but not by chondroitin ABC lyase. [35S]-Sulfate labeled proteoglycans (PGs) derived from cultured ECs and SMCs bound to affinity columns containing A beta (1-28) or (1-40), with virtually no binding to A beta (40-1) (reverse peptide), beta-amyloid precursor protein (410-429), or bovine serum albumin. Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan, weak binding by decorin and biglycan, two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Binding of 125I-labeled perlecan to A beta (1-28) was strongly inhibited by isolated perlecan and to a lesser extent by heparin, but not by chondroitin-6-sulfate or unsulfated dextran sulfate. Heparitinase treatment decreased, but did not eliminate the binding of 125I-labeled perlecan to A beta (1-28).

The CD53 pan-leukocyte glycoprotein is a member of the recently described tetraspan family of cell membrane proteins. The structure and functional characteristics of these molecules indicate that they may play important roles in transmembrane signaling in different cells. Recently, it was reported that cross-linking of CD53 on human B cells led to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium fluxes. In the present study, we wished to further explore the possible role of CD53 in functional B cell responses. Cross-linking of CD53 with the use of the mAb MEM-53 and a polyclonal sheep anti-mouse Ig promoted activation of resting B cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle as judged by increased expression of the early activation Ag CD69, increases in cellular volume, RNA synthesis, and c-myc protein levels, and enhanced binding of 7-aminoactinomycin D. In contrast, MEM-53 alone had no detectable effects. Cross-linking of anti-CD53 induced negligible S phase entry in the absence of other stimuli. However, cytokines, in particular IL-2 and IL-4, potentiated the DNA synthesis induced by cross-linking of CD53. Furthermore, cross-linking of the CD53 Ag induced Ig production in the presence of T cell supernatant.

This indicates that activation of the CD53 protein leads to an increase in the expression of the CD69 protein. The upregulation of CD69 as a result of CD53 activation suggests a functional interaction between the two proteins, where CD53 influences the expression of CD69 during B cell activation.

The CD53 pan-leukocyte glycoprotein is a member of the recently described tetraspan family of cell membrane proteins. The structure and functional characteristics of these molecules indicate that they may play important roles in transmembrane signaling in different cells. Recently, it was reported that cross-linking of CD53 on human B cells led to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium fluxes. In the present study, we wished to further explore the possible role of CD53 in functional B cell responses. Cross-linking of CD53 with the use of the mAb MEM-53 and a polyclonal sheep anti-mouse Ig promoted activation of resting B cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle as judged by increased expression of the early activation Ag CD69, increases in cellular volume, RNA synthesis, and c-myc protein levels, and enhanced binding of 7-aminoactinomycin D. In contrast, MEM-53 alone had no detectable effects. Cross-linking of anti-CD53 induced negligible S phase entry in the absence of other stimuli.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence  ** Explanation:** In the provided context, it is stated that cross-linking of CD53 on resting B cells leads to several activation events, including "increased expression of the early activation Ag CD69, increases in cellular volume, RNA synthesis, and **c-myc protein levels**." This indicates that activation of the CD53 protein directly influences the expression levels of the c-myc protein. The increase in c-myc protein levels upon CD53 cross-linking suggests an interaction between CD53 and the regulatory mechanisms controlling c-myc expression in B cells. Therefore, CD53 protein and c-myc protein interact with each other in the context of B cell activation and differentiation.

HPRD50.d6 HPRD50.d6.s4.e0 HPRD50.d6.s4.e1	Jak2	STAT3	[INST]Context: [PMID: 10925297 Regulation of neutrophil adhesion by pituitary growth hormone accompanies tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, p125FAK, and paxillin. Neutrophil adhesion is fundamentally important during the onset of inflammatory responses. The adhesion signaling pathways control neutrophil arrest and extravasation and influence neutrophil shape and function at sites of inflammation. In the present study the intracellular signaling pathways for the adhesion of human neutrophils by pituitary growth hormone (GH) were examined. Pituitary GH triggered the tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and STAT3 in neutrophils. In addition, pituitary GH treatment resulted in the morphological changes and the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) and paxillin. Preincubation with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked the GH-stimulated adhesion and Jak2, STAT3, p125FAK, and paxillin phosphorylation. Confocal microscopy revealed that pituitary GH stimulates the focal localization of p125FAK, paxillin, phosphotyrosine, and filamentous actin filament into the membrane rufflings and uropods of human neutrophils. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a physical association of Jak2 with p125FAK via STAT3 in vivo. Also an in vitro kinase assay showed an augmentation of p125FAK autophosphorylation as a result of pituitary GH treatment. These results suggest that pituitary GH modulates neutrophil adhesion through tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, p125FAK, and paxillin and actin polymerization.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Jak2 protein] and [STAT3 protein] interact with each other?

Sialoadhesin (Siglec-1) is a macrophage-restricted sialic acid-binding receptor that mediates interactions with hemopoietic cells, including lymphocytes. In this study, we identify sialoadhesin counterreceptors on T lymphocytes. Several major glycoproteins (85, 130, 240 kDa) were precipitated by sialoadhesin-Fc fusion proteins from a murine T cell line (TK-1). Binding of sialoadhesin to these glycoproteins was sialic acid dependent and was abolished by mutation of a critical residue (R97A) of the sialic acid binding site in the membrane distal Ig-like domain of sialoadhesin. The 130- and 240-kDa sialoadhesin-binding glycoproteins were identified as the sialomucins CD43 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (CD162), respectively.

Several key points support this interaction:  - **Binding Experiments:** Sialoadhesin-Fc fusion proteins precipitated CD43 from a murine T cell line (TK-1), demonstrating that sialoadhesin can bind to CD43. - **Sialic Acid Dependency:** The binding of sialoadhesin to CD43 was sialic acid-dependent and was abolished by mutation of a critical residue (R97A) in the sialic acid binding site of sialoadhesin. This suggests a specific molecular interaction mediated by sialic acid residues on CD43. - **Functional Expression:** CD43 expressed in COS cells supported increased binding to immobilized sialoadhesin, further confirming that CD43 can directly interact with sialoadhesin. - **Glycoform Recognition:** Sialoadhesin bound different glycoforms of CD43 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, indicating that the interaction is robust across different forms of CD43.

Cross-linking B cell antigen receptor (BCR) elicits early signal transduction events, including activation of protein tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of receptor components, activation of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma), and increases in intracellular free Ca2+. In this article, we report that cross-linking the BCR led to a rapid translocation of cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1C to the particulate fraction, where it became associated with a 140-150-kD tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein. Western blotting analysis identified this 140-150-kD protein to be CD22. The association of PTP-1C with CD22 was mediated by the NH2-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of PTP-1C.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence.  ** Explanation:**  Based on the provided context, there is strong evidence that the CD22 protein and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1C (PTP-1C) interact with each other. The text explicitly states that upon B cell activation, PTP-1C translocates to the particulate fraction where it becomes associated with a tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein identified as CD22. This association is mediated through the NH₂-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of PTP-1C, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction.  Furthermore, the context mentions that complexes containing CD22 and PTP-1C can be isolated from stimulated B cells, reinforcing the idea of their interaction within a signaling complex. The interaction appears to be functionally significant, as the presence of a null mutant of PTP-1C leads to increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of CD22, suggesting that PTP-1C regulates CD22 phosphorylation levels through this interaction.  These findings collectively demonstrate that CD22 and PTP-1C not only associate with each other but also that their interaction plays a role in modulating B cell signal transduction pathways.

Western blotting analysis identified this 140-150-kD protein to be CD22."* This shows that PTP-1C associates directly with CD22 upon B cell activation.    - *"The association of PTP-1C with CD22 was mediated by the NH2-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of PTP-1C."* This specifies the molecular domains involved in the interaction, indicating a direct binding between the two proteins.  - *"Transient expression of CD22 and a null mutant of PTP-1C (PTP-1CM) in COS cells resulted in an increase in tyrosyl phosphorylation of CD22 and its interaction with PTP-1CM."* This demonstrates that the interaction influences the phosphorylation state of CD22, further evidencing a functional interaction.  - *"These results suggest that tyrosyl-phosphorylated CD22 may be a substrate for PTP-1C regulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of CD22."* This suggests that CD22 is directly dephosphorylated by PTP-1C, indicating a substrate-enzyme relationship between the two proteins.  Given these multiple pieces of evidence from the context, it is clear that PTP-1C and CD22 proteins interact directly, both physically and functionally, in B cell signaling pathways.
