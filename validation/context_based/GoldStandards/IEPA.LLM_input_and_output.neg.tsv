298749 2A2740346 2A2817922	PKC	C34	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34784647 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dietary fibre comprises a complex group of polysaccharides that are indigestible but are fermented by gut microbiota, promoting beneficial effects to the intestinal mucosa indirectly through the production of short chain fatty acids. We found that a polysaccharide, rhamnogalacturonan, from the plant Acmella oleracea, has direct effects on intestinal epithelial barrier function. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Monolayers of colonic epithelial cell lines (Caco-2, T84) and of human primary cells from organoids were mounted in Ussing chambers to assess barrier function. The cellular mechanism of rhamnogalacturonan effects on barrier function was determined using inhibitors of TLR-4 and PKC isoforms. KEY RESULTS: Apically applied rhamnogalacturonan (1000___mug___ml-1 ) significantly enhanced barrier function as shown by increased transepithelial electrical resistance and reduced fluorescein isothiocyanate -dextran flux in Caco-2, T84 and human primary cell monolayers, and accelerated tight junction reassembly in Caco-2 cells in a calcium switch assay. Rhamnogalacturonan also reversed the barrier-damaging effects of inflammatory cytokines on FITC-dextran flux and preserved the tight junction distribution of occludin. Rhamnogalacturonan activated TLR4 in TLR4-expressing HEK reporter cells, an effect that was inhibited by the TLR4 inhibitor, C34. The effect of rhamnogalacturonan was also dependent on PKC, specifically the isoforms PKCdelta and PKCzeta. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: rhamnogalacturonan enhances intestinal epithelial barrier function through activation of TLR4 and PKC signalling pathways. Elucidation of rhamnogalacturonan mechanisms of action could lead to new, dietary approaches to enhance mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel diseases.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [PKC protein] and [C34 protein] interact with each other?

Myxofibrosarcomas are morphologically heterogeneous soft tissue sarcomas lacking a specific immunohistochemical expression profile and recurrent genetic changes. The study was designed to gain further insights into the molecular landscape of myxofibrosarcomas by targeted re-sequencing of known cancer driver hotspot mutations and the analysis of genomewide somatic copy number alterations. Mutational analysis demonstrated mutations in TP53, PTEN, FGFR3, CDKN2A, and RB1. TP53 mutations were seen in 11 (44%) of patients and detected in myxofibrosarcomas G1, G3, with heterogeneous morphology and G3 with subsequent metastases in 1 patient (16%), 3 patients (42%), 2 patients (62.5%), and 3 patients (75%), respectively.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Are there proteomic differences between endometrial stromal cells of repeated implantation failure, recurrent pregnancy loss and normal fertile women, and is there differential protein expression upon decidualization? DESIGN: This exploratory study investigated the proteome of in-vitro cultured endometrial stromal cells of women with repeated implantation failure (n__^=__^4), women with recurrent pregnancy loss (n__^=__^3) and normal fertile women (n__^=__^4), comparing day 0 with 5 days of decidualization. RESULTS: In the repeated implantation failure group, ANXA6, PSMC5 and FSCN1 were up-regulated (1.9-fold, 2.5-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively), whereas PBXIP1 was down-regulated (7.7-fold) upon decidualization. In the recurrent pregnancy loss group, RPS25 and ACADVL were down-regulated (1.9-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively; false discovery rate 10%) between the non-decidualized and the decidualized samples. In the normal fertile group VIM and RPL23A were down-regulated (1.9-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively). Comparing ratios of expression of decidualized over non-decidualized samples in the different groups revealed six differentially expressed proteins: DUX4L2, CNPY4, PDE7A, CTSK, PCBP2 and PSMD4. Comparison of recurrent pregnancy loss versus normal fertile in the decidualized condition revealed serotransferrin to be differentially expressed. The changes in expression levels for serotransferrin, ANX6, ACDVL and VIM were confirmed by western blot.

Transformation of fibroblasts by various oncogenes, including ras, mos, and src accompanies with characteristic morphological changes from flat to round (or spindle) shapes. Such morphological change is believed to play an important role in establishing malignant characteristics of cancer cells. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is a converging downstream event of transforming activities of many oncogene products commonly found in human cancers. Intracellular calcium is known to regulate cellular morphology. In fibroblasts, Ca2+ influx is primarily controlled by two types of Ca2+ channels (T- and L-types). Here, we report that the T-type current was specifically inhibited in cells expressing oncogenically activated Ras as well as gain-of-function mutant MEK (MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase, a direct activator of MAPK), whereas treatment of ras-transformed cells with a MEK-specific inhibitor restored T-type Ca2+ channel activity. Using a T-type Ca2+ channel antagonist, we further found that suppression of the T-type Ca2+ channel by the activated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is a prerequisite event for the induction and/or maintenance of transformation-associated morphological changes.

Anti-idiotype antibody can induce tumor dormancy in a murine B lymphoma, BCL1, by its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (negative signaling). In human B lymphoma, there is accumulating evidence that the antitumor effect of anti-idiotype or several other B cell-reactive antibodies relates to their ability to act as agonists rather than conventional effector antibodies. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and their inhibitors in anti-IgM-induced cell cycle arrest to better understand the mechanisms underlying cancer dormancy. To accomplish this, we have performed in vitro studies with a human lymphoma cell line (Daudi) because its response to anti-idiotype (or anti-IgM) is similar to that of a BCL1 cell line, more reagents are available, and the results would be particularly pertinent to therapy of human B cell lymphomas. Our results show that cross-linking of membrane IgM on Daudi cells induces an arrest late in G1 and prevents pRb from becoming phosphorylated. The G1 arrest is correlated with an induction of the CDK inhibitor p21 and reduced CDK2 activity, although the level of CDK2 protein was not changed. Coprecipitation of CDK2 with p21 in anti-IgM-treated cells and the unchanged level of cyclin E suggest that p21 is responsible for the reduction of CDK2 activity and therefore blockade of the cell cycle. The induction of p21 was not accompanied by changes in p53 levels. As a result of the G1 block, cyclin A levels sharply declined by 24 h after anti-IgM treatment. There was no evidence for involvement of CDK4 or CDK6 in the blockade. These results provide evidence that membrane IgM cross-linking on Daudi cells induces expression of p21 and a subsequent inhibition of the cyclin E-CDK2 kinase complex resulting in a block to pRb phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest late in G1.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [p53 protein] and [CDK4 protein] interact with each other?

The FERM-PTPs are a group of proteins that have FERM (Band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin homology) domains at or near their N-termini, and protein tyrosine phosphatase domains at their C-termini. Their central regions contain either PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1 homology domains or putative Src homology 3 domain binding sites. The known FERM-PTPs fall into three distinct classes, which we name BAS, MEG, and PEZ, after representative human PTPs. Here we analyze Pez, a novel gene encoding the single PEZ-class protein present in Drosophila. Pez cDNAs were sequenced from the distantly related flies Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila silvestris, and found to be highly conserved except in the central region, which contains at least 21 insertions and deletions. Comparison of fly and human Pez reveals several short conserved motifs in the central region that are likely protein binding sites and/or phosphorylation sites. We also identified novel invertebrate members of the BAS and MEG classes using genome data, and generated an alignment of vertebrate and invertebrate FERM domains of each class. 'Specialized' residues were identified that are conserved only within a given class of PTPs. For PEZ, these residues cluster on and near FERM subdomain F1. Finally, the protein tyrosine phosphatase domain of fly Pez was modeled based on known protein tyrosine phosphatase tertiary structures, and we conclude that Pez is likely a functional phosphatase despite some unusual features of the active site cleft sequences. Biochemical confirmation of this hypothesis and genetic analysis of Pez are currently underway.

To identify potential tumor suppressor genes involved in lymphoma development, we generated allelotypes of 16 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC and 31 1,3-butadiene (BD)-induced lymphomas from C57BL/6 x C3H/He F1 (hereafter called B6C3F1) mice. Two or more anonymous simple sequence length polymorphisms per autosome were examined for loss of heterozygosity . The highest frequency of allelic losses was observed on chromosome 12, with 38 and 39% in ddC and BD-induced lymphomas, respectively. The most prevalent loss of heterozygosity was localized to the distal region bounded by markers D12Mit263 and D12Nds2. Detailed analysis localized a potential tumor suppressor gene residing on the distal region of chromosome 2, between markers D2Mit147 and D2Mit148.

Salicylate and jasmonates are two different types of plant hormone that play critical roles in plant defense responses against insect herbivores and microbial pathogens, through activating defense genes. These two natural products have been shown to have similar activities in animal cells: the compounds are able to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells including those of colon, prostate, breast, and leukemia, suggesting the chemicals may potentially be a novel class of anti-cancer drugs. Since sodium salicylate can induce the heat shock response in animals, we examined the effects of jasmonates on the heat shock response in C6 glioma cells. Here, we show that brief exposure to methyl jasmonate, but not to jasmonic acid, induces heat shock protein 72, but not HSP73 and HSP90, via heat shock factor I (HSF1) activation in C6 glioma cells without affecting cell viability. Intracellular H2O2 and O2-, and mitochondrial ROS were prominently increased in response to 5 mM methyl jasmonate in C6 cells.

Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process and a major cellular pathway for the degradation of long-lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. An increasing body of evidence has unveiled autophagy as an indispensable biological function that helps to maintain normal tissue homeostasis and metabolic fitness that can also lead to severe consequences for the normal cellular functioning when altered. Recent accumulating data point to autophagy as a key player in a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions in the human endometrium, one of the most proficient self-regenerating tissues in the human body and an instrumental player in placental species reproductive function.

By using 244 K high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization we studied the genome alterations of 39 fine-needle aspirations from pancreatic adenocarcinoma and eight human adenocarcinoma pancreatic cell lines. Using both visual inspection and GISTIC analysis, recurrent losses were observed on 1p, 3p, 4p, 6, 8p, 9, 10, 11q, 15q, 17, 18, 19p, 20p, 21, and 22 and comprised several known or suspected tumor suppressor genes such as ARHGEF10, ARID1A, CDKN2A/B, FHIT, PTEN, RB1, RUNX1-3, SMAD4, STK11/LKB1, TP53, and TUSC3. Heterozygous deletion of the 1p35-p36 chromosomal region was identified in one-third of the tumors and three of the cell lines.

PURPOSE: The present study evaluates the influence of portal vein vs. inferior vena cava tumor thrombosis sites on the effectiveness of external-beam radiation therapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with macrovascular invasion. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 181 hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein and/or inferior vena cava tumor thrombi who were referred for external-beam radiation therapy at our institution between 2000 and 2009. RESULTS: The median survival was 10.2, 7.4, 17.4, and 8.5 months for patients with portal vein branch, portal vein trunk, inferior vena cava, and portal vein plus inferior vena cava tumor thrombosis, respectively. Unfavorable pretreatment predictors were associated by multivariate analysis with lower albumin and higher alpha-fetoprotein levels, poorer Child-Pugh liver function classification, multiple intrahepatic foci, lymph node metastases, thrombus location, less chance to receive post-external-beam radiation therapy transarterial chemoembolization and the two-dimensional external-beam radiation therapy technique. In comparison to patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis, patients with inferior vena cava thrombi had a higher occurrence of solitary intrahepatic lesions (p = 0.027), well-controlled intrahepatic tumors (p < 0.001), and a better response to external-beam radiation therapy (p < 0.001), and they were more likely to receive post-external-beam radiation therapy transarterial chemoembolization (p = 0.033).

In the past decade, great progress has been made on the cell culture conditions, transcription factor programs and intracellular signaling pathways that control both murine and human embryonic stem cell fates. Embryonic stem cells of mouse vs. human origin have distinct culture conditions, responding to some tyrosine kinase signaling pathways in opposite ways. Previous work has implicated the Src family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases in mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.

Under normal conditions, vascular endothelial cells are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis, although they express detectable Fas on their cell surface. Because oxidized Low density lipoprotein is thought to promote atherogenesis, the potential role that oxidized low density lipoprotein may play in Fas-mediated apoptosis was investigated in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells, focusing particularly on the involvement of the lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1). Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were treated with agonistic anti-Fas antibody (CH11) and oxidized low density lipoprotein and then the degree of apoptosis was determined by cell death ELISA. Oxidized low density lipoprotein concentration-dependently sensitized Fas-mediated apoptosis. On the other hand, treating human umbilical vascular endothelial cells with oxidized low density lipoprotein did not lead to any significant change in the expression of death mediators, including Fas, Fas ligand, FADD, and FLICE as assessed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction amplification. More importantly, these effects of oxidized low density lipoprotein on Fas-mediated apoptosis were significantly blocked by a neutralizing LOX-1 monoclonal antibody, which can block LOX-1-mediated cellular uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein. Oxidized low density lipoprotein may be an important factor involved in the regulation of Fas-induced apoptosis via Ox-LDL/LOX-1 interaction in vascular endothelial cells.

Recent investigations revealed that the 'brittle bone' phenotype in osteogenesis imperfecta is caused not only by dominant mutations in collagen type I genes, but also by recessively inherited mutations in genes responsible for the post-translational processing of type I procollagen as well as for bone formation. The phenotype of patients with mutations in noncollagen genes overlaps with very severe type III and lethal type II osteogenesis imperfecta caused by mutations in collagen genes. Mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation eliminated Pro986 hydroxylation and caused an increase in modification of collagen helix by prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. Loss of complex proteins' function as collagen chaperones may dominate the disease mechanism. The latest findings added to the spectrum of OI-causing and collagen-influencing factors other chaperones (HSP47 and FKBP65) and protein BMP-1, which emphasizes the complexity of collagen folding and secretion as well as their importance in bone formation.

BECN1/Beclin 1 is regarded as a critical component in the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex to trigger autophagy in mammalian cells. Despite its significant role in a number of cellular and physiological processes, the exact function of BECN1 in autophagy remains controversial. Here we created a BECN1 knockout human cell line using the TALEN technique. Surprisingly, the complete loss of BECN1 had little effect on LC3 (MAP1LC3B/LC3B) lipidation, and LC3B puncta resembling autophagosomes by fluorescence microscopy were still evident albeit significantly smaller than those in the wild-type cells. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that BECN1 deficiency led to malformed autophagosome-like structures containing multiple layers of membranes under amino acid starvation.

Ultraviolet B radiation causes direct cellular damage by breakage of DNA strands and oxidative stress induction in aquatic organisms. To understand the effect of ultraviolet b radiation on the rotifer, Brachionus sp., several parameters including 24-h survival rate, population growth rate, and reactive oxygen species level were measured after exposure to a wide range of ultraviolet b doses. To check the expression of other important inducible genes such as replication protein A, DNA-dependent protein kinase, Ku70, Ku80, and heat shock proteins after ultraviolet b radiation, we observed dose- and time-dependency at 2kJ/m(2). Results showed that ultraviolet b remarkably inhibited the population growth of Brachionus sp. The level of intracellular reactive oxygen species was high at 2kJ/m(2), suggesting that 2kJ/m(2) would already be toxic. This result was supported by other enzymatic activities, such as GSH levels, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione reductase. For dose dependency, low doses of ultraviolet b radiation (2, 4, and 6kJ/m(2)) significantly up-regulated the examined genes (e.g. replication protein a, dna-dependent protein kinase, Ku70, and Ku80). For the time course study, replication protein a genes showed immediate up-regulation but returned to basal or lower expression levels compared to the control 3h after ultraviolet b exposure. At the basal level, the hsp90alpha1 gene showed the highest expression, and followed by hsp10, hsp30, hsp60, and hsc70, and hsp90beta in adults (w/o egg). In eggs, the hsp10 gene was expressed the highest, and followed by hsp30, hsp27, hsp90alpha1, and hsp60 genes. In real-time RT-PCR array on rotifer hsp genes, low doses of ultraviolet b radiation (2 and 4kJ/m(2)) showed up-regulation of several hsp genes but most of the hsp genes showed down-regulation at 8kJ/m(2) and higher, indicating that significant Hsp-mediated cellular damage already occurred at low doses. For the time course study of four hsp genes (hsp20, hsp27, hsp70, hsp90alpha1), they showed a significant correlation for ultraviolet b radiation (2kJ/m(2)).

A better understanding of the microenvironment in relation to lymph node metastasis is essential for the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies against cervical cancer. In the present study, we investigated the microenvironment of tumor-draining lymph nodes of patients with cervical cancer by comprehensive flow cytometry-based phenotyping and enumeration of immune-cell subsets in tumor-negative (LN(-), n = 20) versus tumor-positive lymph nodes (LN(+), n = 8), and by the study of cytokine release profiles (n = 4 for both LN(-) and LN(+)). We found significantly lower CD4(+) and higher CD8(+) T-cell frequencies in LN(+) samples, accompanied by increased surface levels of activation markers (HLA-DR; ICOS; PD-1; CTLA-4) and the memory marker CD45RO. The LN(+) antigen-presenting cell subset correlated with significantly elevated frequencies of FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg). After in vitro stimulation with different Toll-like receptor ligands (PGN; Poly-IC; R848), we observed higher production levels of IL6, IL10, and TNFalpha but lower levels of IFNgamma in LN(+) samples. We conclude that, despite increased T-cell differentiation and activation, a switch to a profound immune-suppressive microenvironment in LN(+) of patients with cervical cancer will enable immune escape.

BACKGROUND: Protein-energy wasting and heightened inflammation are prevalent in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and is a strong risk factor for morbidity and mortality in these patients. Evaluation of protein-energy wasting, prevalence of inflammation as well as interrelationship between various nutritional indices and inflammation has not been studied in much detail in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to evaluate the interrelationship between protein-energy wasting and inflammation in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-three patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (M = 28, F = 35) were assessed with regard to their nutritional status and inflammation after a minimum of 3 months continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis initiation. In addition, their serum albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, and cholesterol level were measured. Also, inflammation in these patients was assessed by High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP > 3 mg/L) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6 > 2 _g/mL). Later on, diagnosis of malnutrition was made based on different methods. Correlation between inflammation and various nutritional assessment indices were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age of the patients was 57.6 (11.6) years. The mean values of serum protein, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, cholesterol, triglyceride, hs-CRP, and IL-6 were 5.9 g/dL, 3.0 g/dL, 21.11 mg/dL, 130.6 mg/dL, 155.9 mg/dL, 136.1 mg/dL, 8.8 +- 7.6 mg/L, and 8.4 +- 12.2 _g/dL, respectively. 11.63 (17.4%), 34.63 (54%), and 18.65 (28.6%) patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis had normal, moderate, and severe malnutrition status, respectively. According to serum albumin level; 13.63 (21%), 39.63 (62%), and 11.63 (17%) patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis had normal, moderate, and severe malnutrition status, respectively. 33.63 (52%), 23.63 (37%), and 7.63 (11%) patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis had normal, moderate, and severe malnutrition status, respectively. About 76.1% and 9.5% of patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis were malnourished based on lean tissue index and fat tissue index, respectively. Based on hs-CRP and IL-6 findings, 70% (44/63) and 71.8% (45/63) of patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis had high inflammation, respectively. High sensitive C-reactive protein correlated negatively (significantly) with serum albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin. Interleukin -6 correlated negatively (significantly) with mid-arm circumference; Serum albumin, cholesterol, and transferrin. There was significant positive correlation between hs-CRP and IL-6. There is statistically significant difference in total protein intake (g/d), protein intake (g/kg/d), serum protein (g/dL), albumin (g/dL), transferrin (mg/dL), and cholesterol (mg/dL) between patients with and without inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Protein-energy wasting (80% - 85%) by various methods and inflammation (70%) was very prevalent among patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.

INTRODUCTION: HLA-B*35 is associated with increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension in SSc patients. We previously reported that HLA-B*35 induces endothelial cell dysfunction via activation of ER stress/UPR and upregulation of the inflammatory response. Because PBMCs from lcSSc-PAH patients are also characterized by activation of ER stress/UPR and inflammation, the goal of this study was to assess whether the presence of HLA-B*35 contributes to those characteristics. METHODS: PBMCs were purified from healthy controls (n___=___49 HC) and lcSSc patients, (n___=___44 with PAH, n___=___53 without PAH). RESULTS: ER stress markers, in particular the chaperones BiP and DNAJB1 were significantly elevated in PBMC samples carrying the HLA-B*35 allele. IL-6 expression was also significantly increased in HLA-B*35 lcSSc PBMCs and positively correlated with ER stress markers. Likewise, HMGB1 was increased in HLA-B*35-positive lcSSc PBMCs. Among genes downregulated by HLA-B*35 lentivirus were genes related to complement (C1QB, C1QC), cell cycle and apoptosis (Bax, Gadd45). Interestingly, complement genes (C1QC and C1QB) showed elevated expression in lcSSc without PAH, but were expressed at the low levels in lcSSc-PAH. Furthermore, HLA-B*35 correlated with decreased expression of cyclin inhibitors (p21, p57) and pro-apoptotic genes (Bax, Gadd45) in lcSSc B35 subjects. FYN, a tyrosine kinase involved in proliferation of immune cells, was among the genes that were positively regulated by HLA-B*35. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that HLA-B*35 contributes to the dysregulated expression of selected ER stress, inflammation and proliferation related genes in lcSSc patient PBMCs, as well as healthy individuals, thus supporting a pathogenic role of HLA-B*35 in the development of PAH in SSc patients.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Gadd45 protein] and [HMGB1 protein] interact with each other?

BACKGROUND: Differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells into retinal lineages offers great potential for medical application. METHODS: In this study, we used microarrays to analyze transcriptomes of terminally differentiated retinal ganglion cell and retinal pigment epithelium lineages, as well as intermediate retinal progenitor cells of optic vesicles derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. In our analysis, we specifically focused on the classes of transcripts that encode intrinsic regulators of gene expression: the transcription factors and epigenetic chromatin state regulators. RESULTS: We found that among the most highly overexpressed TF-encoding genes in the OV/retinal ganglion cell lineage were three members of the Collier/Olfactory-1/Early B-cell family: EBF1, EBF2 and EBF3. Knockdown of EBF1 led to significant impairment of differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells into RGCs. EBF1 was shown to act upstream of ISL1 and BRN3A, the well-characterized regulators of retinal ganglion cell lineage specification. TF-encoding genes DLX1, DLX2 and INSM1 were the most highly overexpressed genes in the optic vesicles, indicating their important role in the early stages of retinal differentiation. Along with MITF, the two paralogs, BHLHE41 and BHLHE40, were the most robust TF markers of retinal pigment epithelium cells. The markedly contrasted expression of ACTL6B, encoding the component of chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, discriminated hiPSC-derived OV/retinal ganglion cell and retinal pigment epithelium lineages. CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel, potentially important intrinsic regulators of retinal ganglion cell and retinal pigment epithelium cell lineage specification in the process of differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We demonstrated the crucial role played by EBF1 in differentiation of RGCs. We identified intrinsic regulator biomarker signatures of these two retinal cell types that can be applied with high confidence to confirm the cell lineage identities.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [INSM1 protein] and [BHLHE40 protein] interact with each other?

Chronic hyperglycemia has deleterious effects on pancreatic beta-cell function and survival in type 2 diabetes due to the low expression level of endogenous antioxidants in the beta-cells. Peroxiredoxin-3 is a mitochondria specific H202 scavenger and protects the cell from mitochondrial damage. However, nothing is known about how glucotoxicity influences peroxiredoxin-3 function in the pancreatic beta cells. Exposure of rat insulinoma INS-1__^cells and human beta cells (1.1B4) to high glucose conditions (30mM) stimulated acetylation of peroxiredoxin-3 which facilitates its hyper-oxidation causing mitochondrial dysfunction by SIRT1 degradation. SIRT1 deficiency induces beta cell apoptosis via NOX-JNK-p66Shc signalosome activation. Herein we investigated the direct effect of Teneligliptin, a newer DPP-4 inhibitor on beta-cell function and survival in response to high glucose conditions. Teneligliptin treatment enhances SIRT1 protein levels and activity by USP22, an ubiquitin specific peptidase. Activated SIRT1 prevents high glucose-induced peroxiredoxin-3 acetylation by SIRT3 resulted in inhibition of peroxiredoxin-3 hyper-oxidation thereby strengthening the mitochondrial antioxidant defense. Notably, we identify peroxiredoxin-3 as a novel SIRT3 target and show their physical interaction. Intriguingly, inhibition of SIRT1 activity by EX-527 or SIRT1 siRNA knockdown exacerbated the SIRT3 mediated peroxiredoxin-3 deacetylation which leads to peroxiredoxin-3 hyper-oxidation and beta-cell apoptosis by the activation of NOX-JNK-p66Shc signalosome. Collectively, our results unveil a novel and first direct effect of high glucose on peroxiredoxin-3 acetylation on beta-cell dysfunction by impaired antioxidant defense and SIRT1 mediated SIRT3-peroxiredoxin-3 activation by Teneligliptin suppresses high glucose-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SIRT3 protein] and [USP22 protein] interact with each other?

Ischemic cerebrovascular disease cases were subtyped according to Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) or subdivided into CS and non-CS patients by ultrasonography in a separate analysis. RESULTS: Three polymorphisms located in the lipoprotein lipase, angiotensinogen and guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta-3 genes were significantly associated with ischemic cerebrovascular disease after correction for age and gender. The strongest association was found for the protective lipoprotein lipase Ser447Term polymorphism. Factor VII, apolipoprotein E and two renin polymorphisms were differentially frequent in patients with evidence of CS compared with non-CS patients.

Protein moonlighting could be one way of explaining the seemingly small number of proteins that are encoded in the human genome. It is emerging that moonlighting proteins can exhibit novel biological functions, thus extending the range of the human functional proteome. For example, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, heat-shock protein 60 and tRNA synthetases play a wide range of biological roles in eukaryotic cells, and a growing number of eukaryotic moonlighting proteins are recognized to play important roles in physiological processes such as sperm capacitation, implantation, immune regulation in pregnancy, blood coagulation, vascular regeneration and control of inflammation. The dark side of protein moonlighting finds a range of moonlighting proteins playing roles in various human diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, HIV and cystic fibrosis. However, some moonlighting proteins are being tested for their therapeutic potential, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein, for rheumatoid arthritis, and Hsp90 for wound healing.

OBJECTIVE: Androgens and other drugs that reduce plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol are often considered to be pro-atherogenic. Tibolone lowers HDL-cholesterol by 20% but the clinical significance of this effect is unknown. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind study, 34 women received 2.5 mg tibolone daily and 34 women received placebo. Serum concentrations of lipids, lipoprotein subclasses and apolipoproteins, together with plasma activities of lipid transfer proteins and lipolytic enzymes and the capacity of plasma to induce cholesterol efflux from cultured cells, were measured. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, tibolone reduced serum concentrations of HDL-cholesterol (-14%), high density lipoprotein phosphatidylcholine (-14%), apolipoprotein A-I (-12%), high density lipoprotein subclasses lipoprotein A-I (-20%), HDL-apoE (-16%), pre beta-LpA-I (-10%) and alpha-LpA-I (-12%) and increased hepatic lipase activity (+25%) and high density lipoprotein sphingomyelin : phosphatidylcholine ratio (10.5%), but did not alter serum concentrations of high density lipoprotein sphingomyelin, apoA-IV and LpA-I/A-II, lipoprotein lipase, the plasma activities of lecithin : cholesterol acyl transferase, cholesteryl ester transfer protein, phospholipid transfer protein or the plasma capacity to release cholesterol from cultured fibroblasts or Fu5AH hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Tibolone lowers HDL-cholesterol in part by increasing hepatic lipase activity. Conservation of sphingomyelin and apoA-II in high density lipoprotein, as well as cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity, preserves the capacity of plasma to release cholesterol, despite the lower concentrations of HDL-cholesterol.

Background: Apoptosis is one of the causes of immune depression in sepsis. Pyroptosis also occurs in sepsis. The toll-like receptor 4 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) have been shown to play important roles in apoptosis and pyroptosis. However, it is still unknown whether TLR4 inhibition decreases apoptosis in sepsis. Methods: Stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with or without lipopolysaccharides and high-mobility group box 1 were cultured with or without TLR4 inhibition using monoclonal antibodies from 20 patients with sepsis. Caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activities were measured. The cell death of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was detected using a flow cytofluorimeter. Results: After TLR4 inhibition, b cell lymphoma 2 to bcl2-associated x ratio elevated both in lipopolysaccharides and HMGB1-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The activities of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 did not change in lipopolysaccharides or HMGB1-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common childhood malignancy, is characterized by recurring structural chromosomal alterations and genetic alterations, whose detection is critical in diagnosis, risk stratification and prognostication. However, the genetic mechanisms that give rise to acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain poorly understood. METHODS: Using next-generation sequencing in matched germline and tumor samples from 140 pediatric Chinese patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we landscaped the gene mutations and estimated the mutation frequencies in this disease. RESULTS: Our results showed that the top driver oncogenes having a mutation prevalence over 5% in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia included KRAS (8.76%), NRAS (6.4%), FLT3 (5.7%) and KMT2D (5.0%). While the most frequently mutated genes were KRAS, NRAS and FLT3 in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common mutations were enriched in NOTCH1 (23.1%), FBXW7 (23.1%) and PHF6 (11.5%) in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia . These mutant genes are involved in key molecular processes, including the Ras pathway, the Notch pathway, epigenetic modification, and cell-cycle regulation. Strikingly, more than 50% of mutations occurred in the high-hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia existed in Ras pathway, especially FLT3 (20%). We also found that the epigenetic regulator gene KMT2D, which is frequently mutated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, may be involved in driving leukemia transformation, as evidenced by an in vitro functional assay.

Hepatitis C virus Core protein is implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma . We utilized a HepG2 human hepatocyte cell line with inducible expression of hepatitis c virus Core protein to investigate the early effects of Core protein on hepatocyte gene expression and to identify molecular processes modulated by the Core protein. A significant change was observed in the expression of 407 genes, which included genes regulating apoptosis, immune response, and cell cycle. The decreased expression of chemo-attractants such as TNFSF10, CCL20, and osteopontin was observed, which suggested that hepatitis c virus Core expression could lead to suppression of inflammatory response as well as trafficking of macrophages and neutrophils to the site of hepatitis c virus infection.

Chronic nonhealing wounds, such as venous ulcers, are a widespread and serious medical problem with high morbidity and mortality. Among these candidates, miR-16, -20a, -21, -106a -130a, and -203 were confirmed to be aberrantly overexpressed in a cohort study of 10 VU patients by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridizations. These microRNAs were predicted to target multiple genes important for wound healing, including early growth response factor 3, vinculin, and leptin receptor . Overexpression of the top up-regulated miRNAs, miR-21 and miR-130a, in primary human keratinocytes down-regulated expression of the endogenous leptin receptor and early growth response factor 3. The luciferase reporter assay verified leptin receptor as a direct target for miR-21 and miR-130a. Both miR-21 and miR-130a delayed epithelialization in an acute human skin wound model. Furthermore, in vivo overexpression of miR-21 inhibited epithelialization and granulation tissue formation in a rat wound model.

Endothelial cells are routinely exposed to elevated glucose concentrations post-prandially in healthy individuals and permanently in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes, and so we assessed their sugar transport capabilities in response to high glucose. In human umbilical vein, saphenous vein, microdermal vessels and aorta, GLUT1 (SLC2A1), GLUT3 (SLC2A3), GLUT6 (SLC2A6), and in microdermal vessels also GLUT12 (SLC2A12), were the main glucose transporters as assessed by mRNA, with no fructose transporters nor SGLT1 . GLUT1 and GLUT3 proteins were detected in all cell types and were responsible for ~60% glucose uptake in human umbilical vein, where both GLUT1 and GLUT3, but not GLUT6 siRNA knock-down, reduced the transport. Under shear conditions, GLUT1 protein decreased, GLUT3 increased, and 14C-deoxy-glucose uptake was attenuated. In high glucose, lipid storage was increased, cell numbers were lower, 14C-deoxy-glucose uptake decreased owing to attenuated GLUT3 protein and less surface GLUT1, and trans-endothelial transport of glucose increased due to cell layer permeability changes. We conclude that glucose transport by endothelial cells is relatively resistant to effects of elevated glucose.

Background: Non-functional pituitary adenoma is a common tumor that occurs in the pituitary gland, and generally without any symptoms at its early stage and without clinical elevation of hormones, which is commonly diagnosed when it grows up to compress its surrounding tissues and organs. Currently, the pathogenesis of non-functional pituitary adenoma has not been clarified yet. It is necessary to investigate molecular alterations in non-functional pituitary adenoma, and identify reliable biomarkers and drug therapeutic targets for effective treatments. Differentially expressed genes between non-functional pituitary adenoma and control tissues were obtained from GEO datasets. Two hub molecules (SRC and AKT1) were verified with Western blotting. Results: Totally 6076 proteins in non-functional pituitary adenoma tissues were identified, and 3598 differentially expressed genes between non-functional pituitary adenoma and control tissues were identified from GEO database. KEGG pathway analysis of 6076 proteins obtained 114 statistically significant pathways, including endocytosis, and spliceosome signaling pathways. KEGG pathway analysis of 1088 overlapped molecules obtained 52 statistically significant pathways, including focal adhesion, cGMP-PKG pathway, and platelet activation signaling pathways. According to the association degree in Cytoscape, ten hub molecules (DEGs; proteins) were identified, including GAPDH, ALB, ACACA, SRC, ENO2, CALM1, POTEE, HSPA8, DECR1, and AKT1. Western-blotting analysis confirmed the upregulated expressions of SRC and PTMScan experiment confirmed the increased levels of pAKT1, in NFPAs compared to controls.

GSTP1 is a member of the Glutathione-S-transferase family silenced by CpG island DNA hypermethylation in 90-95% of prostate cancers. However, prostate cancers expressing GSTP1 have not been well characterized. We used immunohistochemistry against GSTP1 to examine 1673 primary prostatic adenocarcinomas on tissue microarrays with redundant sampling from the index tumor from prostatectomies. GSTP1 protein was positive in at least one TMA core in 7.7% of cases and in all TMA cores in 4.4% of cases. The percentage of adenocarcinomas from Black patients who had any GSTP1 positive TMA cores was 14.9%, which was 2.5 times higher than the percentage from White patients (5.9%; P < 0.001). Further, the percentages of tumors from Black patients who had all TMA spots positive for GSTP1 (9.5%) was 3-fold higher than the percentage from White patients (3.2%; P<0.001). In terms of association with other molecular alterations, GSTP1 positivity was enriched in ERG positive cancers among Black men. By in situ hybridization, GSTP1 mRNA expression was concordant with protein staining, supporting the lack of silencing of at least some GSTP1 alleles in GSTP1-positive tumor cells.

RATIONALE: The intimate mechanisms of early onset anemia observed in critically ill patients with septic shock remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: We investigated erythropoiesis abnormalities in this setting by studying morphologic, functional, and biochemical patterns of erythroid lineage. METHODS: Erythroid lineage in the bone marrow from patients with septic shock who developed early-onset anemia was compared with that of healthy control subjects. Biochemical and flow cytometry patterns of apoptosis were dissected by exploring antiapoptotic (erythropoietin [Epo] receptor-dependent) and proapoptotic (death receptor-dependent) pathways. Apoptosis of glycophorin-A-positive erythroid precursors was increased in patients versus control subjects as assessed by labeling with annexin V (26.1 +/- 8.8 vs. 3.1 +/- 2.9%, p < 0.05) or 3-3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (55.9 +/- 10.5 vs. 19.1 +/- 5.4%, p < 0.05), respectively. This was associated with significant overexpression of Fas on erythroid precursors and higher tumor necrosis factor-alpha plasma levels in patients with septic shock vs. control subjects. Moreover, growth capacities of late erythroid progenitors of burst-forming unit erythroids at Day 10 were impaired in the presence of serum from patients with septic shock as compared with the effect of serum from control subjects (27 +/- 12 vs. 109 +/- 27 per 10(5) seeded cells, respectively; Saturating concentrations of recombinant human Epo restored growth capacity of patients' burst-forming unit erythroids (72 +/- 14 per 10(5) seeded cells) in autologous conditions of serum.

METHODS: Twenty New Zealand female rabbits were included in the study. A total of 75 IU FSH + 75 IU LH was given daily by i.m. route for the first 7 days and additionally 2500 IU HCG was given on the last day of ovarian stimulation. Between days 0 and 9, oral enalapril tablets (2 mg/kg) were given twice daily to 10 rabbits (group 1). The remaining 10 rabbits did not receive enalapril (group 2). Laparatomy was performed on all rabbits at day 9.

Chronic administration of immunosuppressants has been associated with long-term consequences, including a higher risk of neoplasm development. The processes regulating telomere function exert a major influence on human cancer biology. The present study aimed to assess the effect of immunosuppressive therapy on the expression of genes associated with telomere maintenance and protection in patients following renal transplantation. A total of 51 patients that had undergone kidney transplantation and 54 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The 51 transplant patients received a three-drug immunosuppressive regimen consisting of cyclosporine A, prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil. In stage 1 of the study, the expression profiles of 123 transcripts, which represented 70 genes, were assessed in peripheral mononuclear blood cells using an oligonucleotide microarray technique in 8 transplant recipients and 4 healthy control subjects. However, only the ACD (adrenocortical dysplasia homolog) gene, encoding the telomere-binding protein POT1-interacting protein 1, was sufficiently specific for telomere homeostasis. The expression of ACD was downregulated in transplant recipients (fold change, 2.11; P=0.006). In stage 2 of the study, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of ACD, DKC1 and hTERT mRNA was conducted for all transplant patients and control subjects. The results confirmed the downregulation of the ACD gene in patients that had received immunosuppressive therapy (P=0.002). The results of the present study indicate that the downregulation of ACD gene transcription, and thus telomere-binding protein pot1-interacting protein 1 protein expression, may enhance the capacity for cell immortalization, despite normal levels of other key telomere maintenance factors, in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

Translation elongation factor 1beta is a member of the family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, proteins whose activities are important for the regulation of G proteins critical to many cellular processes. Elongation factor 1beta is a highly conserved protein that catalyzes the exchange of bound GDP for GTP on EF-1alpha, a required step to ensure continued protein synthesis. In this work, we demonstrate that the highly conserved C-terminal region of Saccharomyces cerevisiae elongation factor 1beta is sufficient for normal cell growth. This region of yeast and metazoan elongation factor 1beta and the metazoan EF-1beta-like protein EF-1delta is highly conserved. Human elongation factor 1beta, but not human EF-1delta, is functional in place of yeast elongation factor 1beta, even though both elongation factor 1beta and EF-1delta have previously been shown to have guanine nucleotide exchange activity in vitro.

Four variants of human beta globin in which the Trp at position 37 has been replaced with a Tyr, Ala, Gly, or Glu have been expressed in Escherichia coli. These globins have been combined with normal human alpha chains and heme to form tetrameric hemoglobin molecules. The kinetics of CO binding to the deoxygenated derivatives following rapid mixing and of CO rebinding following flash photolysis have been examined as functions of pH in the presence and absence of the organic phosphate inositol hexaphosphate, IHP. The kinetic measurements indicate that replacement of the tryptophan with other residues destabilizes the hemoglobin tetramer, resulting in considerable dissociation of even the deoxygenated hemoglobins into alphabeta dimers at micromolar protein concentrations. Substitutions at beta37 also alter the properties of the deoxygenated hemoglobin tetramer. The alteration of the functional properties of the T states of these variants as well as the tendency of the deoxygenated derivatives to dissociate into alphabeta dimers increases in the order HbA < betaW37Y < betaW37A < betaW37G < betaW37E. Measurements of the geminate rebinding of CO establish a kinetic difference between the normal R state tetramer and the alphabeta dimer consistent with quaternary enhancement, the greater affinity of oxygen for the R state tetramer than for the alphabeta dimer. Kinetics of geminate rebinding also suggest that quaternary enhancement may be altered by substitutions at the beta37 position.

INTRODUCTION: Cell biological and genetic evidence implicate failures in degrading aggregating proteins, such as tau and TDP-43, through the autophagy or lysosomal pathways in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration . METHODS: We investigated changes in the degradative pathways in 60 patients with different pathological or genetic forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration employing immunohistochemistry for marker proteins such as lysosomal-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LAMP-2), cathepsin D and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha . RESULTS: Lower levels of neuronal lysosomal-associated membrane proteins 1 immunostaining were present in the dentate gyrus and temporal cortex in FTLD-tau compared to FTLD-TDP. There was less lysosomal-associated membrane proteins 1 immunostaining in FTLD-tau with MAPT mutations, and FTLD-tau with Pick bodies, compared to FTLD-TDP types A and B, and less lysosomal-associated membrane proteins 1 immunostaining in FTLD-TDP type C than in FTLD-TDP types A and B. There were no differences in neuronal LAMP-2, cathepsin d, EEA-1 or light chain 3 alpha immunostaining between any of the five frontotemporal lobar degeneration histological or four genetic groups, nor between FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau.

Dysregulation of these mechanisms facilitates the aggregation of misfolded proteins and forms aggresomes in the juxta nuclear position of the cell which are removed by lysosome-mediated autophagy pathway in the subsequent cell division. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the cell is hallmark of several neurological disorders and other diseases including cancer. However, the exact mechanism of aggresome formation and clearance is not thoroughly understood. Reports have shown that several proteins including p300, p53, TAU, alpha-synuclein, SOD, etc. contain intrinsically disordered region which has the tendency to form aggresome. To study the nature of aggresome formation and stability of the aggresome, we have chosen Twist1 as a model protein since it has intrinsically disordered region s. Twist1 is a bHLH transcription factor which plays a major role in epithelial mesenchymal transition and shown to interact with HAT domain of p300 and p53. In the present study, we generated several deletion mutants of human Twist1 with different fluorescent tags and delineated the regions responsible for aggresome formation. The Twist1 protein contains two NLS motifs at the N-terminal region. We showed that the deletions of regions spanning the amino acids 30-46 (Twist1delta30-46) which lacks the first NLS motif form larger and intense aggregates while the deletion of residues from 47 to 100 (Twist1delta47-100) which lacks the second NLS motif generates smaller and less intense aggregates in the juxta nuclear position. This suggests that both the NLS motifs are needed for the proper nuclear localization of Twist1. The aggresome formation of the Twist1 deletion mutants was confirmed by counterstaining with known aggresome markers: Vimentin, HDAC6, and gamma tubulin and further validated by MG-132 treatment. In addition, it was found that the aggresomes generated by the Twist1delta30-46 construct are more stable than the aggresome produced by the Twist1delta47-100 construct as well as the wild-type Twist1 protein.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Vimentin protein] and [p53 protein] interact with each other?

7712 2A2860621 2A2901699	SETDB1	TRIM28	[INST]Context: [PMID: 31856708 DUF3669, a 'domain of unknown function' within ZNF746 and ZNF777, oligomerizes and contributes to transcriptional repression. BACKGROUND: ZNF746 and ZNF777 belong to a subset of the large Kruppel-associated box zinc finger transcription factor family. They contain, like four other members in human, an additional conserved domain, the 'domain of unknown function 3669' (DUF3669). Previous work on members of this subfamily suggested involvement in transcriptional regulation and aberrant ZNF746 overexpression leads to neuronal cell death in Parkinson's disease. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that N-terminal protein segments of the ZNF746a major isoform and ZNF777 act in concert to exert moderate transcriptional repression activities. Importantly, DUF3669 provides a novel protein-protein interaction interface and mediates direct physical interaction between the members of the subfamily in oligomers. The ZNF746 protein segment encoded by exons 5 and 6 boosted repressor potency, potentially due to the presence of an acceptor lysine for sumoylation at K189. Neither ZNF746a nor ZNF777 protein segments stably associated with TRIM28 within cells. This increase is due to canonical mechanisms known for kruppel-associated box domains since it did not take place in HAP1 knockout models of TRIM28 and SETDB1. A glycine to glutamic acid replacement that complies with a bona fide conserved 'MLE' sequence within KRAB-A led to a further strong gain in repressor potency to levels comparable to those of the canonical ZNF10 kruppel-associated box domain. Each gain of repressive activity was accompanied by an enhanced interaction with TRIM28 protein. CONCLUSION: DUF3669 adds a protein-protein interaction surface to a subgroup of KRAB-zinc finger proteins within an N-terminal configuration with variant kruppel-associated box and adjacent sequences likely regulated by sumoylation.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SETDB1 protein] and [TRIM28 protein] interact with each other?

We have previously confirmed glandular cell CGB and CGA subunit mRNA gene expression as well as the expression of their dimeric and single-subunit human chorionic gonadotropin proteins in normal secretory transformed endometrium. The objective of this study was to investigate the endometrial epithelial gene locus of the human hCG/LH gene cluster from CGB genes responsible for gene expression. For this study, endometrial specimens were selected from women characterized using our endometrium score and human chorionic gonadotropin staining index that had normal secretory transformed endometrium and optimal human chorionic gonadotropin staining. Using full-length CGB mRNA sequence analysis, we found that epithelial CGB is (co)expressed as the product of gene locus CGB7 and CGB6 (48%), as single CGB7 (42%), or to a lower percentage as single CGB6 (10%). In addition to known differences between these genes and CGB5, the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA differs between CGB7 and CGB6 in the untranslated promoter region and in translated exon 2. Immunohistochemical results show that endometrial joint CGB7 and CGB6, single CGB7, and single CGB6 mRNA expression lead to the release of endometrial human chorionic gonadotropin. Gene-specific antibodies for CGB7 reveal secretory endometrial human chorionic gonadotropin production, which is not observed for gene-specific CGB5 antibodies, whereas the placenta is positive for CGB5 and negative for CGB7 antibody as revealed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot human chorionic gonadotropin isoform analysis. Only endometrial CGB7 expression seems to be supported specifically by secretory endometrial transcription factors.

Left ventricular hypertrophy is a common abnormality in hemodialysis patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the progression of left ventricular hypertrophy. As an inner mitochondrial membrane structural protein, mitofilin plays a key role in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between mitofilin and left ventricular hypertrophy in hemodialysis patients. A total of 98___hemodialysis patients and 32 healthy controls were included in the study. Serum N-terminal proBNP, endothelin-1, and atrial natriuretic peptide were examined. The protein level of mitofilin and the mitochondrial DNA copy number were estimated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells . The left ventricle mass index was positively correlated with the n-terminal probnp, endothelin-1, and atrial natriuretic peptide levels, and it was negatively correlated with mitochondrial dna copy number and mitofilin levels. Multiple regression analysis showed that the n-terminal probnp, endothelin-1, and atrial natriuretic peptide levels as well as mitofilin levels and mitochondrial dna copy number were associated with the left ventricle mass index. Although further research of these associations is needed, this result suggests that left ventricular hypertrophy may affect the levels of mitofilin in hemodialysis patients.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [mitofilin protein] and [endothelin-1 protein] interact with each other?

663100 2A2457399 2A2457284	monocyte chemotactic protein-3	eotaxin	[INST]Context: [PMID: 10359886 Effect of AA-2414, a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, on airway inflammation in subjects with asthma. BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. The chemokines are potent chemoattractants for eosinophils and other types of cells associated with allergic inflammation. AA-2414, a new thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, reduces bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic subjects, but its mechanism of action is unclear. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of AA-2414 in asthma result from reduction in the number of inflammatory cells infiltrating the airway associated with inhibition of chemokine release. Lung function and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, significant improvements in symptom score (P <.05), peak expiratory flow (P <.01), diurnal variation of peak expiratory flow (P <.01), and bronchial responsiveness (P <.01) were observed in the AA-2414 group compared with the placebo group. These improvements were accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of submucosal EG2(+) eosinophils (P <.05). There was also a reduction in the number of cells expressing RANTES (P <.05) and macrophage inflammatory protein -1alpha (P <.05) in the epithelium and of cells expressing monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (P <.01), RANTES (P <.05), MIP-1alpha (P <.01), and eotaxin (P <.01) in the submucosa in the AA-2414 treatment group. A significant correlation was found between the number of EG2(+) eosinophils and numbers of monocyte chemotactic protein-3(+) (rs = 0.52, P <.005), MIP-1alpha+ (rs = 0.34, P <.05), and eotaxin+ cells (r s = 0.47, P <.01) in the submucosa. There was a significant negative correlation between the increase in bronchial responsiveness and the change in number of submucosal EG2(+) cells (rs = -0.65, P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AA-2414 treatment of patients with asthma may inhibit activated eosinophil infiltration in part by modulating the expression of chemokines in bronchial tissues.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [monocyte chemotactic protein-3 protein] and [eotaxin protein] interact with each other?

(1995) Biochem. We showed previously that a purified SDK (termed 'SDK1') phosphorylates a specific Ser position of adapter/chaperone protein 14-3-3 isoforms beta, eta, and zeta but not tau or sigma (Megidish, T., et al. (1998) J. In this study we found the following: (i) other sphingosine-dependent kinases with different substrate specificities are present in cytosolic and membrane extracts of mouse Balb/c 3T3 (A31) fibroblasts. (ii) The activation of these sphingosine-dependent kinases is specific to D-erythro-sphingosine and its N-methyl derivatives, the effect of L-threo-Sph or its N-methyl derivatives is minimal, and nonspecific cationic amphiphiles have no effect at all. An SDK separated as fractions 'TN31-33' phosphorylated a 50 kDa substrate which was identified as calreticulin, as well as two endogenous substrates with molecular mass 58 and 55 kDa, both identified as protein disulfide isomerase . This SDK, which specifically phosphorylates calreticulin and protein disulfide isomerase, both molecular chaperones found at high levels in endoplasmic reticulum, is tentatively termed 'SDK2'. One glucose-regulated protein substrate had the same amino acid sequence as GRP94 (synonym: endoplasmin); Another heat shock proteins substrate had the same amino acid sequence as mouse HSP86 or HSP84, the analogues of human HSP90. An SDK activity separated and present in 'fraction 42' from Q-Sepharose chromatography specifically phosphorylated GRP105 (or GRP94) and HSP68 but did not phosphorylate protein disulfide isomerase or 14-3-3. This SDK is clearly different from other sphingosine-dependent kinases in its substrate specificity and is tentatively termed 'SDK3'. Interestingly, substrates of all these sphingosine-dependent kinases so far identified are molecular chaperones or adapters capable of binding to enzymes and key molecules involved in signal transduction, maintaining tertiary structure of bioactive molecules, or maintaining cellular homeostasis in response to environmental stress. Thus, the essential role of sphingosine and dimethyl-sph is to activate molecular chaperones, thereby providing a link to the mechanism by which SDK activity regulates cellular homeostasis and signal transduction.

Trim27 (Zinc finger protein RFP) is a potential regulator of hematopoietic stem cells, yet its role in hematopoiesis remains elusive. Here, we investigated the roles of Trim27 in hematopoiesis by enforcing its expression in mouse and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells . Ectopic expression of Trim27 in mouse fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells confers repopulating advantage with myeloid dominance. However, the number of hematopoietic stem cells from Trim27 group was comparable with empty vector control group, indicating that overexpression of Trim27 unlikely expanded hematopoietic stem cells. Transcriptome analysis of Trim27-overexpressing myeloid progenitor cells (MP) indicated that Trim27 up-regulated essential regulators of myelopoiesis, including Spi1 and Cebpg, up-regulated myeloid proliferation-related signaling genes Nras, Runx1, and Cbfb, up-regulated JAK/STAT signaling inhibitors Socs2, Socs3, and Cish, and up-regulated myeloid maturation-related genes Adam8 and Dek. Moreover, the myeloproliferative advantage caused by overexpressing Trim27/TRIM27 is conserved between mouse and human hematopoiesis.

In the present report, we investigated the effect of ursolic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoid found in rosemary and holy basil, on apoptosis induced by TRAIL. We found that ursolic acid potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. In addition, ursolic acid also sensitized TRAIL-resistant cancer cells to the cytokine. When we investigated the mechanism, we found that ursolic acid down-regulated cell survival proteins and induced the cell surface expression of both TRAIL receptors, death receptors 4 and 5 (DR4 and -5). Induction of receptors by ursolic acid occurred independently of cell type. Gene silencing of either receptor by small interfering RNA reduced the apoptosis induced by ursolic acid and the effect of TRAIL. In addition, ursolic acid also decreased the expression of decoy receptor 2 but not DcR1. Induction of DRs was independent of p53 because ursolic acid induced DR4 and DR5 in HCT116 p53(-/-) cells. Induction of DRs, however, was dependent on JNK because ursolic acid induced JNK, and its pharmacologic inhibition abolished the induction of the receptors. The down-regulation of survival proteins and up-regulation of the DRs required reactive oxygen species because ursolic acid induced reactive oxygen species, and its quenching abolished the effect of the terpene. Also, potentiation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by ursolic acid was significantly reduced by both reactive oxygen species quenchers and JNK inhibitor. In addition, ursolic acid was also found to induce the expression of DRs, down-regulate cell survival proteins, and activate JNK in orthotopically implanted human colorectal cancer in a nude mouse model. Overall, our results showed that ursolic acid potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis through activation of reactive oxygen species and JNK-mediated up-regulation of DRs and down-regulation of decoy receptor 2 and cell survival proteins.

Embryo implantation is one of the most inefficient steps in assisted reproduction, so the identifying drugs with a potential clinical application to improve it has a strong interest. This work applies artificial intelligence and systems biology-based mathematical modeling strategies to unveil potential treatments by computationally analyzing and integrating available molecular and clinical data from patients. The mathematical models of embryo implantation computationally generated here simulate the molecular networks underneath this biological process. Once generated, these models were analyzed in order to identify potential repositioned drugs (drugs already used for other indications) able to improve embryo implantation by modulating the molecular pathways involved. Interestingly, the repositioning analysis has identified drugs considering two endpoints: (1) drugs able to modulate the activity of proteins whose role in embryo implantation is already bibliographically acknowledged, and (2) drugs that modulate key proteins in embryo implantation previously predicted through a mechanistic analysis of the mathematical models. As a result, a list of 23 drug candidates to improve embryo implantation after IVF was identified by the mathematical models. This list includes many of the compounds already tested for this purpose, which reinforces the predictive capacity of our approach, together with novel repositioned candidates (e.g., Infliximab, Polaprezinc, and Amrinone). In conclusion, the present study exploits existing molecular and clinical information to offer new hypotheses regarding molecular mechanisms in embryo implantation and therapeutic candidates to improve it.

To address these problems, we developed a high-throughput network-based quantitative pipeline using agnostic approaches to identify genes expressed abnormally in both type 2 diabetes and neurological diseases, to identify some of the shared molecular pathways that may underpin type 2 diabetes and ND interaction. We employed gene expression transcriptomic datasets from control and disease-affected individuals and identified differentially expressed genes in tissues of patients with type 2 diabetes and ND when compared to unaffected control individuals. One hundred and ninety seven differentially expressed genes (99 up-regulated and 98 down-regulated in affected individuals) that were common to both the type 2 diabetes and the ND datasets were identified. The overlapping differentially expressed genes (i.e., seen in both type 2 diabetes and ND datasets) were then used to extract the most significant GO terms. We performed validation of these results with gold benchmark databases and literature searching, which identified which genes and pathways had been previously linked to neurological diseases or type 2 diabetes and which are novel. Hub proteins in the pathways were identified (including DNM2, DNM1, MYH14, PACSIN2, TFRC, PDE4D, ENTPD1, PLK4, CDC20B, and CDC14A) using protein-protein interaction analysis which have not previously been described as playing a role in these diseases. We thus identified the following TFs as important in driving expression of our T2D/ND common genes: FOXC1, GATA2, FOXL1, YY1, E2F1, NFIC, NFYA, USF2, HINFP, MEF2A, SRF, NFKB1, USF2, HINFP, MEF2A, SRF, NFKB1, PDE4D, CREB1, SP1, HOXA5, SREBF1, TFAP2A, STAT3, POU2F2, TP53, PPARG, and JUN. MicroRNAs that affect expression of these genes include mir-335-5p, mir-16-5p, mir-93-5p, mir-17-5p, mir-124-3p. Thus, our transcriptomic data analysis identifies novel potential links between neurological diseases and type 2 diabetes pathologies that may underlie comorbidity interactions, links that may include potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In sum, our neighborhood-based benchmarking and multilayer network topology methods identified novel putative biomarkers that indicate how type 2 diabetes and these neurological diseases interact and pathways that, in the future, may be targeted for treatment.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [CREB1 protein] and [DNM2 protein] interact with each other?

Chromosomal translocations involving chimeric fusions of the nucleoporin NUP98 protein have often been described in acute myelogenous leukemia . All the fusion proteins have an identical NUP98 N terminus, which contains the GLEBS motif for interaction with the mRNA export factor RAE1 and FG repeats that associate with the transcription factors HDAC1 and p300. We previously showed that RAE1 depletion caused aneuploidy, which enhanced tumorigenesis. We speculated that RAE1 may also be directly involved in NUP98 fusion-mediated leukemogenesis. We show here that RNA interference -mediated knockdown of NUP98 caused severe chromosome segregation defects and disrupted RAE1 but not HDAC1 expression and localization. Next, we performed rescue experiments to confirm that the RAE1-NUP98 complex orchestrates proper chromosome segregation. Interestingly, we found diverse behaviors of NUP98 and the leukemogenic fusion protein NUP98-HOXA9 throughout the cell cycle. Strikingly, in NUP98-HOXA9-transfected cells, RAE1 protein were reduced and mis-localized. Our cellular interpretations were further confirmed by NUP98-HOXA9 transgenic mice and the NUP98-HOXA9 acute myelogenous leukemia patient. These data suggest that RAE1 orchestrates NUP98-mediated leukemogenesis and raise the possibility that targeting this negative feedback loop may provide a new strategy for the therapy of aggressive leukemias.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a slow growing, but relentless cancer. Due to its rarity and lack of understanding of its molecular etiology, no standard chemotherapy for adenoid cystic carcinoma currently exists and many patients suffer from recurrent and/or metastatic disease. To describe and summarize existing clinical trial studies and preclinical discoveries, we surveyed the PubMed on developmental therapeutics for adenoid cystic carcinoma. Objective response rates to monotherapy with cytotoxic agents were approximately 10% with cisplatin, 5-FU, gemcitabine, mitoxantrone, epirubicin, vinorelbine and paclitaxel. Among molecularly targeted drugs, the most studied drugs are inhibitors targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Among those, lenvatinib and axitinib showed a relatively high objective response rate of 11-16% and 9-17%, respectively. Given high recurrence rates and chemoresistance of adenoid cystic carcinoma, treatments targeting cancer stem cells, which function as tumor-initiating cells and drive chemoresistance, may be particularly valuable. Cancer stem cells have been shown to be targetable via MYB, Notch1, p53 and epigenetic mechanisms. Myb overexpression is characteristic in adenoid cystic carcinoma but was previously thought to present a difficult target due to its nature as a transcription factor. However, due to the development Myb-targeted inhibitors and an ongoing clinical trial of MYB-targeted cancer vaccine therapy, MYB is becoming an increasingly attractive therapeutic target. Within the field of epigenetics, treatment with PRMT5 inhibitors has shown 21% partial response rate in phase I clinical trial. Immunotherapies, such as PD-1 inhibitors, are also associated with cancer stem cells, but have not been effective against adenoid cystic carcinoma. However, clinical trials of cancer vaccine therapies are actively being conducted. In addition to conventional chemotherapies and inhibitors of angiogenesis, the emergence of new therapies such as immunotherapy and those targeting cancer stemness is expected to bring clinical benefits to patients in the future.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [PRMT5 protein] and [Notch1 protein] interact with each other?

Parkin is a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. It has been suggested that loss of function in parkin causes accumulation and aggregation of its substrates, leading to death of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson disease. Using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated a RING finger protein that interacted with the N terminus of parkin in a Drosophila cDNA library. Interaction between human parkin and the mammalian RING finger protein homologue Nrdp1/FLRF, a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase that ubiquitinates ErbB3 and ErbB4, was validated by in vitro binding assay, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence co-localization. Significantly, pulse-chase experiments showed that cotransfection of Nrdp1 and parkin reduced the half-life of parkin from 5 to 2.5 h. Consistent with these findings, we further observed that degradation of CDCrel-1, a parkin substrate, was facilitated by overexpression of parkin protein. However, co-transfection of Nrdp1 with parkin reversed the effects of parkin on CDCrel-1 degradation. We conclude that Nrdp1 is a parkin modifier that accelerates degradation of parkin, resulting in a reduction of parkin activity.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [ErbB3 protein] and [CDCrel-1 protein] interact with each other?

A total of 84 intersection differentially expressed genes (32 upregulated and 52 downregulated) were screened in burn injury patients via integrated analyses. Upregulated genes were primarily enriched in regulation of T cell activation, regulation of response to DNA damage stimulus, positive regulation of innate immune response, positive regulation of defense response.

Ecteinascidin 743 (ET-743; Yondelis, Trabectedin) is a marine anticancer agent that induces long-lasting objective remissions and tumor control in a subset of patients with pretreated/resistant soft-tissue sarcoma. Drug-induced tumor control is achievable in 22% of such patients, but there is no clear indication of the molecular features correlated with clinical sensitivity/resistance to ET-743. Nine low-passage, soft-tissue sarcoma cell lines, explanted from chemo-naive patients with different patterns of sensitivity, have been profiled with a cDNA microarray containing 6,700 cancer-related genes. The molecular signature of these cell lines was analyzed at baseline and at four different times after ET-743 exposure. The association of levels of TP53 mutation and TP73 expression with ET-743 sensitivity and cell cycle kinetics after treatment was also analyzed. Gene expression profile analysis revealed up-regulation of 86 genes and down-regulation of 244 genes in response to ET-743.

Validation of select genes was conducted by Northern analysis and RT-PCR using RNA from endometrial biopsies obtained in the proliferative phase and the implantation window and by RT-PCR using RNA from cultured endometrial epithelial and stromal cells. These approaches confirmed up-regulation of genes corresponding to IGFBP-1, glycodelin, CPE1-R, Dkk-1, mammaglobin, and ApoD and down-regulation for PR membrane component 1, FrpHE, matrilysin, and intestinal trefoil factor, as with the microarray data. Cultured endometrial epithelial cells were found to express mRNAs for glycodelin, CPE-1R, Dkk-1, the gamma aminobutyric acid A receptor pi subunit, mammaglobin, matrilysin, intestinal trefoil factor and PR membrane component 1.

Overall, the data demonstrate numerous genes and gene families not heretofore recognized in human endometrium or associated with the implantation process. Reassuringly, several gene products, known to be differentially expressed in the implantation window or in secretory endometrium, were verified, and the striking regulation of select secretory proteins, water and ion channels, signaling molecules, and immune modulators underscores the important roles of these systems in endometrial development and endometrial-embryonic interactions.

BACKGROUND: The physiological significance of a large family of heat-shock proteins, comprised of the cytosolic HSP90A and the endoplasmic reticulum component of HSPB, is evident in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The HSP90A is believed to play critical roles in diverse physiological functions of cell viability and chromosomal stability including stress management. Heightened abundance of hsp90beta transcript was documented in Channa striatus, a freshwater fish, which is capable of surviving within an extremely hypoxic environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: To better understand the mechanism of hsp90beta gene expression, we investigated its genomic organization. Eleven exons were identified, including a long upstream intron with a remarkable similarity with human, but not with chicken counterpart. The driving capability of this minimal promoter was further validated by its binding ability with TATA-box binding protein and the generation of GFP expressing transgenic zebrafish (F2). Further, deletion of an inverted hypoxia inducible factor motif RCGTG (upstream of the TATA-box) dramatically reduced luciferase expression in a hypoxic environment (CoCl2 treated cultivable cells) and was identified as a cis-acting hypoxia inducible factor responsive element, necessary for the hypoxia-induced expression. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained herein provide an insight regarding how hsp90beta gene expression is controlled by hypoxia inducible factor responsive element in teleost both during hypoxia stress management and normal physiological functions, and suggested that the hsp90beta gene promoter could be used as a potential candidate for generating ornamental and food-fish transgenics.

Functional SUMO family members identified in the human placenta include SUMO-1 to SUMO-3, which are elevated in pre-eclampsia. Whether the fourth isoform, SUMO-4, plays a role in placental development and function remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that SUMO-4 is expressed in the human placenta and demonstrates altered SUMOylation in pre-eclamptic pregnancies. METHODS: SUMO-4 mRNA (qRT-PCR) and protein (Western blot and immunohistochemistry) were measured in Jar cells, BeWo cells, first trimester placental villous explants and placental tissues across normal gestation and in pre-eclampsia. SUMO-4 expression in response to oxidative stress (H2O2: 0, 0.1, 1 and 5mM), as well as, hypoxia-reperfusion (O2: 1%, 8% and 20%) was measured. Lastly, SUMO-4 binding (covalently vs. non-covalently) to target proteins was investigated. RESULTS: SUMO-4 mRNA and protein were unchanged across gestation. SUMO-4 was present in the villous trophoblast layer throughout gestation. SUMO-4 mRNA expression and protein levels were increased ~2.2-fold and ~1.8-fold in pre-eclamptic placentas compared to age-matched controls, respectively (p<0.01). SUMO-4 mRNA and protein expression increased in Jars, BeWos and first trimester placental explants with 5mM H2O2 treatment, as well as with exposure to hypoxia-reperfusion. SUMO-1 to SUMO-3 did not show consistent trends across models. SUMO-4 hyper-SUMOylation was predominantly covalent in nature. CONCLUSIONS: SUMO-4 is expressed in normal placental development. SUMO-4 expression was increased in pre-eclamptic placentas and in models of oxidative stress and hypoxic injury.

Cells respond to sub-lethal hear stress by preferential synthesis and accumulation of several members of functionally and compartmentally distinct families of heat shock (or stress) proteins (such as hsp70, hsp90, hsp60 and hsp27). Some of these have been implicated in the development of thermotolerance and resistance to other environmental stresses. The aim of this investigation was to determine the ability of hsp70, hsp90 or hsp60 to individually protect embryonal rat heart-derived H9c2 myocytes against both (i) heat stress and (ii) substrate-free hypoxia. When H9c2 cells were subjected to a sub-lethal stress (43 degrees C for 30 min) they were shown to have elevated levels of hsp70, hsp90 and hsp60 which was maximal between 14-24 h and was associated with increased survival at 24 h against a subsequent lethal heat stress (47 degrees C for 2 h) (20.4 +/- 2.6% v 7.3 +/- 1.8%; P < 0.002). H9c2 myocytes were transfected with a plasmid containing human hsp70i, hsp90 beta or hsp60 expressed under the control of the constitutively active human beta-actin promoter or with control vector alone (containing no hsp gene). Stable colonies of primary transfectants selected for neomycin resistance showed different degrees of over-expression of hsp70i, hsp90 beta or hsp60 expression as determined by Western blotting using specific monoclonal antisera. Cells constitutively expressing high levels of hsp70i showed significantly higher survival against lethal heat stress compared to cells transfected with vector alone (39.2 +/- 6.5% v 4.5 +/- 1.0%; P < 0.0001) and also against 20 h of substrate-free hypoxia (86.4 +/- 3.0% v 3.5 +/- 0.7%; P < 0.0001). Cells constitutively expressing high levels of hsp90 beta also showed significantly higher survival against heat stress (21.5 +/- 3.0% v 9.8 +/- 3.7%; P < 0.05) but were not resistant to 20 hours of substrate-free hypoxia (0.5 +/- 1.0% v 2.0 +/- 1.7%). Cells transfected with the hsp60 plasmid showed no increased survival against either heat stress or substrate-free hypoxia. These results demonstrate that transfection of H9c2 cells with either hsp70i, hsp90 beta or hsp60 genes confers different patterns of protection against heat stress and substrate-free hypoxia, indicating functional differences between stress proteins in their ability to protect against divergent stresses.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy has become a worldwide concern because of the rising prevalence rate of diabetes mellitus . Despite much energy has been committed to diabetic retinopathy research, it remains a difficulty for diabetic patients all over the world. Since apoptosis of retinal microvascular pericytes is the early characteristic of diabetic retinopathy, this study aimed to reveal the mechanism of Shuangdan Mingmu capsule, a Chinese patent medicine, on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of pericytes implicated with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) / glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) pathway. METHODS: Network pharmacology approach was performed to predict biofunction of components of shuangdan mingmu capsule dissolved in plasma on diabetic retinopathy. Both PARP1 and GAPDH were found involved in the hub network of protein-protein interaction of potential targets and were found to take part in many bioprocesses, including responding to the regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process, apoptotic signaling pathway, and response to oxygen levels through enrichment analysis. Human retinal microvascular pericytes cultured with media containing 0.5___mM hydrogen oxide for 4___h was performed as an oxidative-damage model. Different concentrations of shuangdan mingmu capsule, PARP1 inhibitor, PARP1 activation, and GAPDH inhibitor were used to intervene the oxidative-damage model with N-Acetyl-L-cysteine as a contrast. Flow cytometry was performed to determine the apoptosis rate of cells and the expression of reactive oxygen species. Cell counting kit 8 was used to determine the activity of pericytes. Moreover, nitric oxide concentration of cells supernatant and expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, superoxide dismutase, B cell lymphoma 2, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelin 1, PARP1, and GAPDH were tested through RT-qPCR, western blot, or immunocytochemistry . RESULTS: Overproduction of reactive oxygen species, high apoptotic rate, and attenuated activity of pericytes were observed after cells were incubated with media containing 0.5___mM hydrogen oxide. Moreover, downregulation of superoxide dismutase, nitric oxide, b cell lymphoma 2, and GAPDH, and upregulation of VEGFA, endothelin 1, and PARP1 were discovered after cells were exposed to 0.5___mM hydrogen oxide in this study, which could be improved by PARP1 inhibitor and shuangdan mingmu capsule in a dose-dependent way, whereas worsened by PARP1 activation and GAPDH inhibitor.

Although its incidence rates in the West are lower than that in Asia, gastric cancer is still a major health problem worldwide, being second only to lung cancers in the number of deaths it causes. Helicobacter pylori infection has been identified as the major pathogen, but the detailed pathogenesis of gastric carcinoma remains elusive. In this study, we used a proteomic approach to globally analyze the protein profiles of paired surgical specimens of primary gastric adenocarcinoma and nontumor mucosa aiming at identifying specific disease-associated proteins as potential clinical biomarkers and for carcinogenetic study. Some of these alterations involve variations in the expression of cytoskeleton proteins, including an increase in cytokeratin 8 and tropomyosin isoform and a decrease in cytokeratin 20.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer are both known to modulate gene expression patterns in peripheral blood leukocytes . OBJECTIVE: As type 2 diabetes has been shown to increase the incidence of colorectal cancer, we were prompted to check whether diabetes affects mRNA signatures in peripheral blood leukocytes isolated from colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: Twenty-two patients were recruited to the study and classified into four cohorts (healthy controls; type 2 diabetes; colorectal cancer; colorectal cancer and T2DM). RESULTS: 49 genes were found to be significantly up- or downregulated in tumorous diabetic individuals as compared to tumor-free diabetic controls, while 11 transcripts were differentially regulated in patients with colorectal cancer versus healthy, tumor-free and nondiabetic controls. Importantly, these gene sets were completely distinct, implying that diabetes exerts a profound influence on the transcription of signaling genes in colorectal cancer. The top 5 genes showing the most significant expression differences in both contexts were PCK2, MAPK9, CCND1, HMBS, TLR3 (p___0.0040) and CREBBP, PPIA, NFKBIL1, MDM2 and SELPLG (p___0.0121), respectively.

Given that dopamine plays a crucial role working memory, the present study tested whether individual differences in the size of the attentional blink can be predicted by differences in genetic predisposition related to the efficiency of dopaminergic pathways. Polymorphisms related to mesocortical and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways were considered, as well as polymorphisms related to norepinephrine, a transmitter system that has also been suspected to play a role in the attentional blink. In a sample of 157 healthy adults, we studied the dependency of the individual magnitude of the attentional blink and the C957T polymorphism at the DRD2 gene (associated with striatal DA/D2 receptors), the DARPP32 polymorphism (associated with striatal DA/D1), the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism (associated with frontal DA), DBH444 g/a and DBH5'-ins/del polymorphisms (polymorphisms strongly correlated with dopamine beta hydroxylase, the enzyme catalyzing the DA-norepinephrine conversion) and NET T-182C (a polymorphism related to the norepinephrine transporter). DRD2 C957T T/T homozygotes showed a significantly smaller attentional blink, whereas polymorphisms associated with frontal dopamine and norepinephrine were unrelated to performance. This outcome pattern suggests a crucial role of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway and of nigrostriatal D2 receptors, in particular, in the management of attentional resources.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [COMT protein] and [DARPP32 protein] interact with each other?

INTRODUCTION: The entorhinal cortex is among the earliest areas involved in Alzheimer's disease. Human entorhinal cortex atrophy is, in part, due to neural loss, but microglial and/or astroglial involvement in the different layers remains unclear. Additionally, -omic approaches in the human entorhinal cortex are scarce. METHODS: Herein, stereological layer-specific and proteomic analyses were carried out in the human brain. RESULTS: Neurodegeneration, microglial reduction, and astrogliosis have been demonstrated, and proteomic data have revealed relationships with up- (S100A6, PPP1R1B, BAG3, and PRDX6) and downregulated (GSK3B, SYN1, DLG4, and RAB3A) proteins. Namely, clusters of these proteins were related to synaptic, neuroinflammatory, and oxidative stress processes.

Several studies have shown that ionizing radiation induces transcription of the TNFRSF6 (Fas) gene, leading to augmented TNFRSF6 protein levels at the surface of irradiated cells. We have examined TNFRSF6 expression in an apparently normal lymphocyte line and in a lymphocyte cell line derived from a patient with ataxia telangiectasia before and after exposure to radiation (0-10 Gy). Plasma membranes were isolated from normal lymphocytes and ataxia telangiectasia cells and subjected to Western blot analysis, using a TNFRSF6-specific monoclonal antibody to probe resolved proteins transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. In both cell types, the presence of a 48-kDa band corresponding to the molecular mass of TNFRSF6 was revealed. Analysis of FITC-conjugated anti-TNFRSF6 antibody-stained normal lymphocytes and ataxia telangiectasia cells confirmed TNFRSF6 expression in both cell types. In MTT assays, ataxia telangiectasia cells treated with agonistic anti-TNFRSF6 Ab (CH.11) displayed a 25.9% decrease in cell viability, relative to cells treated with isotype-matched IgM Ab, suggesting the presence of a biologically active TNFRSF6 receptor at the ataxia telangiectasia cell surface. Exposure to cycloheximide (0-5 microg/ml), a metabolic inhibitor, enhanced sensitivity of ataxia telangiectasia cells to CH.11. Normal lymphocytes exhibited increased levels of apoptosis (approximately 34% cell death relative to cells treated with isotype-matched IgM Ab) when exposed to CH.11; However, the degree of cell death was not altered significantly with increasing concentrations of cycloheximide. When ataxia telangiectasia cells were exposed to 0.1, 0.5, 2 and 10 Gy, the activities of caspases 3 and 8 increased in a dose-dependent manner at 24 h postirradiation and reached a plateau by 72 h. A similar trend for activation of caspase 3 and 8 was observed in normal lymphocytes after irradiation. To assess the roles of TNFRSF6 and/or caspase 8 in radiation-induced cell death of ataxia telangiectasia and normal lymphocytes, and to determine whether hyper-radiosensitivity in ataxia telangiectasia cells is correlated with increased activity of these two components of the TNFRSF6 pathway, ataxia telangiectasia and normal lymphocytes were irradiated in the presence of ZB4, an anti-TNFRSF6 blocking antibody, and a caspase 8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK). Apoptosis was determined by Annexin V staining using flow cytometry. Incubation with ZB4 anti-TNFRSF6 antibody did not alter the fraction of apoptotic cells in either ataxia telangiectasia cells or normal lymphocytes treated with doses of radiation ranging from 0-10 Gy. In contrast, apoptosis was significantly reduced in both cell lines in the presence of Z-IETD-FMK when samples were exposed to low-dose (< or = 2 Gy) radiation. Relative to control samples (those not incubated with Z-IETD-FMK), no difference in the level of apoptosis was observed in ataxia telangiectasia or normal lymphocytes treated with 10 Gy. These data indicate that: (a) despite radiation-induced up-regulation of TNFRSF6 at the cell surface, the death-promoting receptor does not play a role in radiation-mediated cytotoxicity; (b) apoptosis in lymphocytes irradiated with low (< or = 2 Gy) but not high doses (>2 Gy) proceeds at least in part through activation of caspase 8; And (3) since blocking anti-TNFRSF6 antibody (ZB4) did not reduce levels of apoptosis in irradiated ataxia telangiectasia cells to those of normal lymphocytes, TNFRSF6 is unlikely to play a significant role in the hyper-radiosensitivity exhibited by cells having the ataxia telangiectasia phenotype.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Annexin V protein] and [TNFRSF6 protein] interact with each other?

PURPOSE: Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is a severe form of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps accompanied by asthma and an aspirin intolerance. The underlying pathomechanism of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease still remains unclear, recent data suggest a complex inflammatory imbalance. In the present study, we investigated the cytokine patterns in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and healthy control patients. Furthermore, we describe the change in cytokine level in the course of aspirin desensitization with continuous intake of aspirin. METHODS: The study included a total of 104 participants, 48 healthy controls, 45 patients with nasal polyps and 11 patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease undergoing aspirin desensitization. Nasal secretions were analyzed for IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, THF-alpha, IFN-gamma, eotaxin and ECP using Bio-Plex Human Cytokine Assay and Uni-CAP FEIA. Baseline measurements of cytokine levels were performed in all 104 patients; In patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, follow-up was performed 1-6 and 6-24 months after the initiation of aspirin desensitization. RESULTS: Our preliminary results show a TH2 dominated, eosinophilic milieu in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease patients, which decreased in the first weeks of aspirin desensitization. However, after 6 months of aspirin desensitization, proinflammatory cytokines show a tendency to increase again. Also, TH1 as well as Treg associated cytokine seem to increase over time. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the present work shows the cytokine pattern in nasal secretions of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease patients before and during aspirin desensitization.

The ability of various C-C chemokines to elicit tissue eosinophil infiltration following intradermal injection or peripheral blood eosinophilia following intravenous injection were compared in the Brown-Norway rat. Eotaxin (0.1 - 3 microg site-1) of human and murine origin produced equivalent, dose-dependent increases in eosinophil peroxidase activity in rat dermis 4 h post-injection. Human eotaxin-2 was equipotent with human eotaxin in terms of dermal eosinophil recruitment. Other human CCR3 agonists, such as MCP-3, RANTES and MCP-4 failed to increase dermal eosinophil peroxidase activity at doses up to 1 microg site-1 whereas the latter did produce a small effect at 3 microg site-1. Consistent with observations in vivo, human eotaxin displaced [125I]-eotaxin from rat spleen membranes more potently (IC50=2 nM) than did MCP-4 (IC50=500 nM). RANTES did not compete with the radiolabelled chemokine at concentrations up to 1 microM. Human eotaxin (5 microg) administered intravenously increased circulating eosinophils approximately 3 fold whereas MCP-4 (5 microg i.v.) increased circulating monocytes approximately 3 fold without affecting eosinophil numbers. Dexamethasone pretreatment inhibited eotaxin-induced dermal eosinophil influx only at a steroid dose (0.1 mg kg-1, s.c.) which significantly reduced circulating eosinophil numbers. The steroid also reduced eosinophilia in peripheral blood resulting from systemic eotaxin administration (5 microg, i.v.). These data suggest differences in rat CCR3 relative to other species as surmised from a distinctive rank order of chemokine potency. In addition to its chemotactic effects eotaxin, but not MCP-4, promotes eosinophil recruitment into the circulation. One of the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, acutely inhibits eotaxin-induced dermal eosinophil influx is to diminish the circulating numbers of these cells available for tissue recruitment.

We have recently shown that HPV+ HNC cells are more sensitive to radiation than HPV- HNC cells. However, roles of HPV oncogenes in regulating the response of DNA damage repair remain unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using immortalized normal oral epithelial cell lines, HPV+ HNC derived cell lines, and HPV16 E7-transgenic mice we assessed the repair of DNA damage using gamma-H2AX foci, single and split dose clonogenic survival assays, and immunoblot. The ability of E7 to modulate expression of proteins associated with DNA repair pathways was assessed by immunoblot. RESULTS: HPV16 E7 increased retention of gamma-H2AX nuclear foci and significantly decreased sublethal DNA damage repair. While phospho-ATM, phospho-ATR, Ku70, and Ku80 expressions were not altered by E7, Rad51 was induced by E7. Correspondingly, HPV+ HNC cell lines showed retention of Rad51 after gamma-radiation.

Using primary cell culture, we validated the ability of hepatocytes from ethanol-fed mice to secrete a large amount of high mobility group box-1. Selective ablation of Hmgb1 in hepatocytes protected mice from alcohol-induced liver injury due to increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, phosphorylated 5'AMP-activated protein kinase-alpha, and phosphorylated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha expression along with elevated LDL plus VLDL export. Native and post-translationally modified high mobility group box-1 were detected in humans and mice with alcoholic liver disease. In liver and serum from control mice and in serum from healthy volunteers, the lysine residues within the peptides containing nuclear localization signals 1 and 2 were non-acetylated, and all cysteine residues were reduced. However, in livers from ethanol-fed mice, in addition to all thiol/non-acetylated isoforms of high mobility group box-1, we observed acetylated NLS1 and NLS2, a unique phosphorylation site in serine 35, and an increase in oxidation of high mobility group box-1 to the disulfide isoform. In serum from ethanol-fed mice and from patients with alcoholic liver disease, there was disulfide-bonded hyperacetylated high mobility group box-1, disulfide-bonded non-acetylated high mobility group box-1, and high mobility group box-1 phosphorylated in serine 35. Hepatocytes appeared to be a major source of these high mobility group box-1 isoforms. Thus, hepatocyte high mobility group box-1 participates in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease and undergoes post-translational modifications that could condition its toxic effects.

Kidney function is affected in COVID-19, while kidney itself modulates the immune response. Here, hypothesize if COVID-19 urine biomarkers level can assess immune activation vs. clinical trajectory. Considering the kidney's critical role in modulating the immune response, we sought to analyze activation markers in patients with pre-existing dysfunction. This was a cross-sectional study of 68 patients. Serum level ferritin, procalcitonin, IL-6 assessed immune activation overall, while the response to viral burden was gauged with serum level of spike protein and alphaspike IgM and IgG.

However, omega 6 FAs can alter cellular metabolism via inflammation or modulation of mitochondrial function. Fetal linoleic acid is obtained from the maternal diet, and FAs are transported to the fetus via placental fatty acid transporters and binding proteins (FABPs), but specific proteins responsible for linoleic acid transport in placental trophoblasts are unknown. Dietary linoleic acid consumption is increasing, but the effect of elevated linoleic acid on trophoblast function is not clear. METHODS: Swan71 trophoblasts were exposed to physiological and supraphysiological concentrations of linoleic acid for 24 hours. Cell viability, citrate synthase activity and mitochondrial respiration were determined. RESULTS: Exposure to 300 and 500 muM linoleic acid increased FATP1 and FATP4 mRNA expression. 500 muM linoleic acid increased FATP1 and FATP4 protein expression. Exposure to 500 muM increased FABP5 mRNA expression, while exposure to 100 to 500 muM linoleic acid decreased FABP3 mRNA expression. 300 and 500 muM linoleic acid decreased FABP3 protein expression. Cell viability was decreased by exposure to linoleic acid (100 to 1000 muM). Citrate synthase activity and routine mitochondrial respiration were significantly decreased by exposure to 300 and 500 muM linoleic acid, and maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity were decreased by exposure to 100 to 500 muM linoleic acid. 300 and 500 muM linoleic acid increased reactive oxygen species generation in human trophoblasts. Moreover, exposure to 300 and 500 muM linoleic acid decreased IL-6 secretion. Exposure to 500 muM linoleic acid increased IL-8, NF-kappaB and PPAR-gamma mRNA expression, but decreased NF-kappaB protein expression. 300 muM linoleic acid decreased IL-8 protein expression. Further, exposure to 100 to 500 muM linoleic acid increased prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B___ release.

There have been few investigations of cancer prognosis models based on Bayesian hierarchical models. In this study, we used a novel Bayesian method to screen mRNAs and estimate the effects of mRNAs on the prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Based on the identified mRNAs, we can build a prognostic model combining mRNAs and clinical features, allowing us to explore new molecules with the potential to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. The mRNA data (n___=___594) and clinical data (n___=___470) for lung adenocarcinoma were obtained from the TCGA database. Gene set enrichment analysis, univariate Cox proportional hazards regression, and the Bayesian hierarchical Cox proportional hazards model were used to explore the mRNAs related to the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. With the Bayesian hierarchical Cox proportional hazards model, a 14-gene signature that included CPS1, CTPS2, DARS2, IGFBP3, MCM5, MCM7, NME4, NT5E, PLK1, POLR3G, PTTG1, SERPINB5, TXNRD1, and TYMS was established to predict overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma. The C-index of the model was 0.733 and 0.735, respectively, after performing cross-validation and external validation, a nomogram was provided for better prediction in clinical application.

650504 2A2418080 2A2903080	apolipoprotein D	TIMP-1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 16186358 PURPOSE: To identify and characterize genes differentially expressed in anterior segment tissues of eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucoma. METHODS: Anterior segment tissues (iris, ciliary processes, lens epithelium) were obtained from eight surgically enucleated eyes with PEX-associated open-angle or closed-angle glaucomas and eight age-matched glaucomatous control eyes without pseudoexfoliation. CDNA libraries were generated from three pseudoexfoliation and three control specimens, and their gene expression patterns were compared by means of cDNA subtraction. RESULTS: Subtraction of cDNA libraries identified 27 candidate genes for differential expression in pseudoexfoliation tissues, of which 23 genes were confirmed by virtual Northern blot, RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization. One set of genes consistently upregulated in anterior segment tissues from different patients with pseudoexfoliation comprised latent transforming growth factor binding proteins (LTBP-1 and -2), which are structural components of elastic microfibrils, the cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase-2, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), A-kinase anchor protein-2, apolipoprotein D, and the adenosine receptor-A3 . Genes reproducibly downregulated in pseudoexfoliation tissues included TIMP-1, clusterin, microsomal glutathione-S-transferase-1, and serum amyloid A1. Further transcripts, such as elastase, GST-T1, integrin beta4, and dehydrocholesterol reductase, did not show a consistent differential expression pattern in tissues obtained from different patients. Although fibrillin-1 was not isolated from subtracted cDNA libraries, upregulated expression of this elastic microfibrillar component was also demonstrated by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. CONCLUSIONS: Differentially expressed genes with a high level of reproducibility in different tissues and different patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome are mainly related to extracellular matrix metabolism and cellular stress. The underlying pathophysiology of pseudoexfoliation syndrome appears to be associated with an excessive production of elastic microfibril components, enzymatic cross-linking processes, a proteolytic imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, and increased cellular and oxidative stress supporting the notion of pseudoexfoliation syndrome as a stress-induced elastic microfibrillopathy.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [apolipoprotein D protein] and [TIMP-1 protein] interact with each other?

Symptomatic patients with long qt syndrome had experienced more stressful life events (OR=1.16 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.24)) and the level of vital exhaustion (OR=3.40 (95% CI 1.44 to 8.03)) was more than three times higher among patients with long qt syndrome with arrhythmic events than in asymptomatic long qt syndrome mutation carriers. The association between stressful life events and arrhythmic events was independent of age, sex, specifically focused medication and long qt syndrome subtype. CONCLUSIONS: A history of stressful life events and prolonged mental stress are associated with arrhythmic events in long qt syndrome in this large sample of molecularly defined patients with long qt syndrome.

Background: HIV-exposed uninfected infants (HEU) are at higher risk of severe infections, hospitalizations and death compared with HIV-unexposed uninfected infants (HUU), but the immune deficit underlying it is not known. To address this gap, we investigated T cell functionality and its relationship to phenotypic profiles of T cells and antigen presenting cells in HEU and HUU. Methods: Blood mononuclear cells from 55 HEU and 16 HUU were stimulated with Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B or mock for 72 h, and tested by flow cytometry for proliferation and expression of Th1, Th2, and regulatory (Treg) markers. In parallel, cells were phenotypically assessed for differentiation profiles of Treg, conventional T cell and antigen presenting cells in unstimulated cells. Results: HEU had lower CD4+ functional responses to SEB/mock and similar CD8+ responses compared with HUU. In the phenotypic T cell panel, HEU showed higher proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ Treg expressing IL10, FOXP3, and CD25; And lower na_^ve and CD4+TGFbeta+ Treg compared with HUU. In the phenotypic antigen presenting cells panel, HEU showed higher proportions of CD1c+ cDC2, CD123+ pDC, CD16+ inflammatory monocytes and cDC and higher expression of CD103 on CD1c-CD123-CD16-cDC1 compared with HUU. Regression analyses adjusted for HIV exposure and multiple comparisons showed that higher CD8+IL10+ and CD8+FOXP3+ Treg in unstimulated cells were associated with lower CD8+ T cell functional responses to SEB/mock. Functionality was not affected by t cell differentiation, but higher antigen presenting cells activation in aggregate was associated with higher CD8+IL10+ Treg responses to staphylococcal enterotoxin b.

BACKGROUND: Retinal microglial cells play crucial roles in maintaining normal visual functions in a healthy eye. However, the underlying mechanisms of retinal microglial cells over-activation manifesting the alterations of sensome profile and inflammation state, which contribute to various retinal neurodegenerative diseases, remain elusive. Here, we aimed to identify the core set of sensome and pro-inflammatory genes and their regulators using transcriptome and data mining approaches. METHODS: We performed paired-end RNA-sequencing in primary microglial cell cultures treated with TNFalpha/IFN__ (10 ng/ml for 12 h) and PBS as a control. We examined overlaps of the mouse microglial gene expression profiles with the data-mined human sensome and pro-inflammatory marker genes. The core sets of sensome and pro-inflammatory genes were selected and predicted for transcription factors . RESULTS: TNFalpha/IFN__ induced 668 differentially expressed transcripts in retinal microglial cells relative to the control. The overlapping analysis of the TNFalpha/IFN__-activated microglia genes and the data-mined human gene sets revealed 22 sensome and 61 pro-inflammatory genes. Based on network analysis, we determined 10 genes as the core sets of sensome and pro-inflammatory genes and predicted the top ten transcription factors that regulate them. The SP110, IRF1, FLI1, SP140 (sensome) and RELB, BATF2, NFKB2, TRAFD1, SP100, NFKB1 (inflammation) are differentially expressed between the TNFalpha/IFN__ activated and the non-activated microglia which were validated by quantitative PCR. The outcomes indicate that these transcriptional regulators are highly expressed and may regulate the sensome and inflammatory genes of retinal microglial cells and switch them to over-activation.

We investigated the effects of AT-101/cisplatin combination treatment on the expression levels of apoptotic proteins and epigenetic events such as DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase enzyme activities in OVCAR-3 and MDAH-2774 ovarian cancer cells. For showing apoptosis, both DNA Fragmentation and caspase 3/7 activity measurements were performed. The expression levels of apoptotic proteins were assessed by human apoptosis antibody array. Dna methyltransferase and histone deacetylase activities were evaluated by ELISA assay and mRNA levels of DNMT1 and HDAC1 genes were quantified by qRT-PCR. Combination of AT-101/cisplatin resulted in strong synergistic cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells. Combination treatment reduced some pivotal anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, HIF-1A, cIAP-1, XIAP in OVCAR-3 cells, whereas p21, Bcl-2, cIAP-1, HSP27, Clusterin and XIAP in MDAH-2774 cells. Among the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bad, Bax, Fas, phospho-p53 (S46), Cleaved caspase-3, SMAC/Diablo, TNFR1 and Cytochrome c were induced in OVCAR-3 cells, whereas, Bax, TRAILR2, FADD, p27, phospho-p53 (S46), Cleaved caspase-3, Cytochrome c, SMAC/Diablo and TNFR1 were induced in MDAH-2774 cells.

Recent studies in multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, point to the fact that even in the early phase of inflammation, neuronal pathology plays a pivotal role in the sustained disability of affected individuals. We show that the major green tea constituent, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), dramatically suppresses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced by proteolipid protein 139-151. EGCG reduced clinical severity when given at initiation or after the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by both limiting brain inflammation and reducing neuronal damage. In orally treated mice, we found abrogated proliferation and TNF-alpha production of encephalitogenic T cells. In human myelin-specific CD4+ T cells, cell cycle arrest was induced, down-regulating the cyclin-dependent kinase 4. Interference with both T cell growth and effector function was mediated by blockade of the catalytic activities of the 20S/26S proteasome complex, resulting in intracellular accumulation of IkappaB-alpha and subsequent inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Because its structure implicates additional antioxidative properties, EGCG was capable of protecting against neuronal injury in living brain tissue induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate or TRAIL and of directly blocking the formation of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species in neurons. Thus, a natural green tea constituent may open up a new therapeutic avenue for young disabled adults with inflammatory brain disease by combining, on one hand, anti-inflammatory and, on the other hand, neuroprotective capacities.

Endometrial cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide, affecting more than 300,000 women annually. Dysregulated gene expression, especially those mediated by microRNAs, play important role in the development and progression of cancer. This study aimed to investigate differentially expressed genes in endometrial adenocarcinoma using next generation sequencing and bioinformatics. The gene expression profiles and microRNA profiles of endometrial adenocarcinoma (cancer part) and normal endometrial tissue (non-cancer part) were assessed with next generation sequencing. We identified 56 significantly dysregulated genes, including 47 upregulated and 9 downregulated genes, in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Most of these genes were associated with defense response, response to stimulus, and immune system process, and further pathway analysis showed that human papillomavirus infection was the most significant pathway in endometrial adenocarcinoma. In addition, these genes were also associated with decreased cell death and survival as well as increased cellular movement. The analyses using Human Protein Atlas, identified 6 genes (PEG10, CLDN1, ASS1, WNT7A, GLDC, and RSAD2) significantly associated with poorer prognosis and 3 genes (SFN, PIGR, and CDKN1A) significantly associated with better prognosis. Combining with the data of microRNA profiles using microRNA target predicting tools, two significantly dysregulated microRNA-mediated gene expression changes in endometrial adenocarcinoma were identified: downregulated hsa-miR-127-5p with upregulated CSTB and upregulated hsa-miR-218-5p with downregulated HPGD.

Background: Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease with serious consequences and a high rate of morbidity and mortality, In our previous work, we reveal the key features of proteins in new-onset ankylosing spondylitis patients. Material and Methods: Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the spine, and inflammation plays an essential role in ankylosing spondylitis pathogenesis. The inflammatory process in ankylosing spondylitis, however, is still poorly understood due to its intricacy. Systematic proteomic and phosphorylation analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to investigate potential pathways involved in ankylosing spondylitis pathogenesis. Results: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed and discovered 782 differentially expressed proteins and 122 differentially phosphorylated proteins between 9 new-onset ankylosing spondylitis patients and 9 healthy controls. Parallel reaction monitoring analysis verified that 3 proteins (HSP90AB1, HSP90AA1 and HSPA8) in the antigen processing and presentation pathway, 6 proteins (including ITPR1, MYLK and STIM1) in the platelet activation pathway and 10 proteins (including MYL12A, MYL9 and ROCK2) in the leukocyte transendothelial migration pathway were highly expressed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ankylosing spondylitis patients.

Cross-linking of IgE or a bacterial product (f-Met-Leu-Phe; FMLP) induces the release of leukotriene C4 and histamine in human basophils. However, the signaling mechanisms in human basophils are only partially understood. It has been demonstrated that extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) specifically regulate the pathway for leukotriene c4 generation, but not for histamine release and interleukin-4 production. More recent studies have suggested that tyrosine kinase (syk)-mediated phosphorylation of shc is responsible for the ras-ERK cascade via the formation of shc-Grb2-Sos2 following stimulation with anti-IgE antibody, but not FMLP, in human basophils. However, while characterizing the role of phosphatidylinositol -3 kinase in signaling pathways leading to basophil mediator release, it was noted that this pathway might also regulate p21ras activation. Anti-IgE antibody, but not FMLP, resulted in phosphorylation of p85 (regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase), suggesting activation of PI3 kinase. Inhibition of PI3 kinase by selective inhibitor (LY294002) abolished anti-IgE antibody- but not FMLP-induced phosphorylation of MEK1 (MAPK kinase/ERK kinase) and ERKs while inhibiting leukotriene c4 generation as well as histamine release. But, further upstream, phosphorylation of syk and of shc and inducible association between shc and Grb2 were not affected.

The context mentions that phosphorylation of p85 (regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase) suggests activation of PI3 kinase, which regulates the MEK-ERK pathway. However, it also states that phosphorylation of syk and shc, as well as the inducible association between shc and Grb2, are not affected by PI3 kinase inhibition. This suggests that the p85 protein and the syk protein are part of separate signaling pathways and do not directly interact with each other.</s>
159718 2A2623617 2A2528133	LGALS4	ETHE1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 34249670 Colorectal cancer is one of the major causes of cancer deaths across the world. Patients' survival at time of diagnosis depends mainly on stage of the tumor. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms from low-grade to high-grade stages of cancer that lead to cellular migration from one tissue/organ to another tissue/organ is essential for implementing therapeutic approaches. We suggested for the first time that downregulation of mitochondrial genes, including ETHE1, SQOR, TST, and GPX3, would help colorectal cancer cells to produce more energy under hypoxic conditions through mechanisms that are different from 'Warburg Effect'. Augmentation of given antioxidants and repression of P4HA1 and COL1A2 genes could be a choice of colorectal cancer treatment. Moreover, promoting active GSK-3beta together with expression control of EIF2B would prevent EMT. We also proposed that OAS1 expression enhancement can induce the anti-cancer effects of interferon-gamma, while suppression of CTSH hinders formation of focal adhesions. ATF5 expression suppression sensitizes cancer cells to anchorage-dependent death signals, while LGALS4 induction recovers cell-cell junctions. These inhibitions and inductions would be another combinatory mechanism that inhibits EMT and cell migration. Furthermore, expression inhibition of TMPO, TOP2A, RFC3, GINS1, and CKS2 genes could prevent tumor growth. Besides, TRIB3 suppression would be a promising target for anti-angiogenic therapy. SORD is a poorly studied enzyme in cancer, found to be upregulated in colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Kinases are key mediators of inflammation, highlighting the potential of kinase inhibitors as treatments for inflammatory disorders. Selective kinase inhibitors, however, have proved disappointing, particularly in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The activity of a narrow spectrum kinase inhibitor, TOP1210, has been compared with selective kinase inhibitors (BIRB-796, dasatinib and BAY-61-3606) in a range of kinase assays, inflammatory cell assays, and in inflamed biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis . Effects on recombinant P38alpha, Src, and Syk kinase activities were assessed using Z-lyte assays (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom). Anti-inflammatory effects were assessed by measurement of proinflammatory cytokine release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, primary macrophages, HT29 cells, inflamed colonic ulcerative colitis biopsies, and myofibroblasts isolated from inflamed colonic ulcerative colitis mucosa. RESULTS: TOP1210 potently inhibits P38alpha, Src, and Syk kinase activities. Similarly, TOP1210 demonstrates potent inhibitory activity against proinflammatory cytokine release in each of the cellular assays and the inflamed colonic ulcerative colitis biopsies and myofibroblasts isolated from inflamed colonic ulcerative colitis mucosa. However, combination of the selective inhibitors led to improved efficacy and potency in both cellular and ulcerative colitis biopsy assays. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted, multikinase inhibition with TOP1210 leads to a broad efficacy profile in both the innate and adaptive immune responses, with significant advantages over existing selective kinase approaches, and potentially offers a much improved therapeutic benefit in inflammatory bowel disease.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [P38alpha protein] and [Syk protein] interact with each other?

AIM: 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, a PAH derivative initializes cascades of signaling events that alters a variety of enzymes responsible for lipid and glucose homeostasis resulting in enhanced availability and consumption of energy producing molecules for the development of carcinogenesis. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) is a key enzyme regulating the pathway of synthesis of cholesterol whereas liver-X-receptor regulates lipid, carbohydrate metabolism in various malignancies including mammary carcinogenesis . In this study Taxifolin, a potential flavanoid has been subjected to evaluate its anti-cancer potential on . METHODS: We designed to screen the molecular docking analysis of taxifolin on LXRalpha, LXRbeta, HMG-CoAR, mTOR and PTEN using MAESTRO tool comparing with their reference ligands. Mammary carcinogenesis was developed by the administration of dimethylbenz(a)anthracene in the air pouch (under the mammary fat pad) of the female Sprague-Dawley rats (55 days old). After 90 days of cancer induction, the chemotherapeutic potential of taxifolin was evaluated by administering taxifolin at different doses (10, 20 and 40__^mg/kg b.w./day). RESULTS: The docking analysis revealed significant interaction with liver-x-receptor (alpha&beta), HMG-CoAR, mTOR and PTEN. The docking results were validated with the enzyme inhibition assay using HMG-CoAR (EC 1.1.1.34). Taxifolin inhibited the HMG-CoAR activity with an IC50 value of 97.54__^_+-__^2.5__^nM whereas the reference molecule pavastatin revealed an IC50 value of 84.35__^_+-__^1.2__^nM. Moreover, taxifolin modulated the energy regulation on DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis in SD-rats by significantly restoring the cancer-induced alterations in body weight, tumor growth and lipid, lipoproteins, lipid metabolizing enzymes and glycolytic enzymes. Taxifolin interacted with LXRs, HMG-CoAR, metabolic enzymes and restored the altered metabolism that accelerates uncontrolled cell proliferation in mammary carcinogenesis. Moreover, taxifolin also altered the mRNA and protein expressions of HMG-CoAR, liver-x-receptor (alpha,beta), Maf1, PTEN, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt, mTOR, fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 in a dose dependent manner.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate surface markers showing specific changes during the chondrogenic differentiation and dedifferentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells . METHODS: Human mesenchymal stem cells from adult bone marrow were subjected to chondrogenic differentiation in 3-dimensional alginate culture with or without transforming growth factor beta3 for 2 weeks, followed by dedifferentiation in monolayer for 1 week. Surface antigens were selected from those previously reported to show changes in expression during dedifferentiation of human articular chondrocytes . RESULTS: Flow cytometry was used to identify 3 groups of surface antigens with differential expression patterns that were quite different from those previously reported on human articular chondrocytes. Two groups of antigens were expressed at high levels on human mesenchymal stem cells. The expression of the first group of antigens (CD44, CD58, CD81, CD90, CD105, and CD166) was decreased reversibly by the 3-dimensional alginate culture and irreversibly in the presence of transforming growth factor beta3, except for CD81, which showed reversible changes regardless of transforming growth factor beta3. The expression of the second group of antigens (CD49c, CD49e, and CD151) was decreased during chondrogenic differentiation only in the presence of transforming growth factor beta3. During all experimental stages, the expression of the third group of antigens (CD14, CD26, CD49f, CD54, CD106, CD119, and CD140a) was maintained at low levels (expressed on <30% of cells), although with some fluctuations.

33125 2A2769796 2A2769798	RECQL4	RECQL5	[INST]Context: [PMID: 32523948 RECQL5 at the Intersection of Replication and Transcription. Maintenance of genome stability is essential to prevent the accumulation of DNA mutations that can initiate oncogenesis and facilitate tumor progression. Studies of DNA repair genes have revealed a highly dynamic and redundant network of genes and proteins responsible for maintaining genome stability. Cancer cells are often deficient in DNA repair, and the resulting genome instability decreases their fitness but also allows for more rapid evolution under selective pressure. Of particular interest for genome stability are the RecQ class of helicases. Five genes in this class, RECQL1, BLM, WRN, RECQL4, and RECQL5, are unique to mammals, as simpler eukaryotes and bacteria appear to have only one homolog, RecQ. Whereas loss of function mutations of BLM, WRN, and RECQL4 in humans are associated with specific diseases, RECQL1 and RECQL5 have not yet been associated with specific disorders. Mice deficient in Recql5 are more likely to develop cancer, and human cells deficient in RECQL5 display chromosomal instability and elevated sister chromatid exchange events, similar to cells deficient in any of the other RecQ helicases. Recent studies support the hypothesis that RECQL5 can resolve intermediate DNA repair structures resulting from the collision of DNA transcription and replication machinery. In this review, we aim to summarize current knowledge regarding RECQL5 in the context of DNA repair, replication, and transcription to help uncover the role of RECQL5 in the maintenance of genome stability.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [RECQL4 protein] and [RECQL5 protein] interact with each other?

Homeobox-containing genes play crucial roles in various developmental processes, including body-plan specification, pattern formation and cell-type specification. The present study searched the draft genome sequence and cDNA/EST database of the basal chordate Ciona intestinalis to identify 83 homeobox-containing genes in this animal. This number of homeobox genes in the Ciona genome is smaller than that in the Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, human and mouse genomes.

Deoxycytidine was found in the culture medium of thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages, along with thymidine, which was shown by others to be a possible immunoregulatory substance. The identification of deoxycytidine was based on: (1) cochromatography with the authentic compound in four different solvents, (2) UV absorption spectral analysis, and (3) the enzymatic peak shift method. Phagocytosis of nucleated chicken erythrocytes, but not enucleated sheep erythrocytes, increased deoxycytidine excretion. The macrophages lacked both deoxycytidine kinase and deoxycytidine deaminase, which is consistent with their excretory pattern.

OBJECTIVE: Ethanol used by women during pregnancy increases the risk for microtia in the foetus. Traditionally, laboratory experiments and Mouse Genome Informatics have been used to explore microtia pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to screen and verify hub genes involved in ethanol-induced microtia and to explore the potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Overlapping genes related to ethanol and microtia were acquired from the GeneCards database and filtered by confidence score. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis results were visualized with the clusterProfiler R package. RESULTS: Overall, 41 genes related to both ethanol and microtia were identified. The genes most relevant to ethanol-induced microtia pathogenesis included FGFR-2, FGFR-3, FGF-8, TP53, IGF1, SHH, CTNNB1, and PAX6, among others. Most genes were strongly enriched for tissue and organ development in gene ontology analysis. Additionally, many genes were enriched in the Ras, FoxO, MAPK, and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways in kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis.

Preeclampsia (gestational hypertension) is accompanied by decreased hPL and increased hCG levels in maternal serum. The expression of these peptides as well as the endocrine mechanisms responsible for their regulation in preeclampsia are unknown. We have demonstrated that regulatory GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) are implicated in the modulation of hPL production by placentas from normal pregnancies. In order to extend our knowledge on placental endocrinology, we analyzed in this study the expression of hPL and beta-hCG mRNAs as well as placental G protein alpha-subunits in pregnancies complicated by gestational hypertension. Western and Northern blot analyses were respectively performed on membrane protein and total mRNA preparations from human placentas of preeclamptic (n = 7) and normal pregnancies (n = 4). The levels of hPL and beta-hCG mRNAs were respectively 108% and 105% of those from normal placentas, suggesting that the altered circulating levels of hPL and beta-hCG are not related to dysfunctional mRNA expression of these peptides. Specifically, G alpha i2, G alpha i3, G alpha o, G alpha s, and G alpha q/11 levels reached 87%, 81%, 91%, 99%, and 103% respectively of those from normal placentas. In parallel with the protein levels, their mRNAs expression were respectively 93%, 89%, 113%, 104%, and 94% of normal values for G alpha i2, G alpha i3, G alpha o, G alpha s, and G alpha q/11.

73615 2A2526426 2A2509801	HER3	Cdc2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 24909175 A novel function of HER2/Neu in the activation of G2/M checkpoint in response to gamma-irradiation. In response to gamma-irradiation -induced DNA damage, activation of cell cycle checkpoints results in cell cycle arrest, allowing time for DNA repair before cell cycle re-entry. Human cells contain G1 and G2 cell cycle checkpoints. While G1 checkpoint is defective in most cancer cells, commonly due to mutations and/or alterations in the key regulators of G1 checkpoint (for example, p53, cyclin D), G2 checkpoint is rarely impaired in cancer cells, which is important for cancer cell survival. G2 checkpoint activation involves activation of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated /ATM- and rad3-related signalings, which leads to the inhibition of Cdc2 kinase and subsequent G2/M cell cycle arrest. Previous studies from our laboratory show that G2 checkpoint activation following irradiation exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells is dependent on the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling. As HER receptor tyrosine kinases, which have important roles in cell proliferation and survival, have been shown to activate ERK1/2 signaling in response to various stimuli, we investigated the role of HER receptor tyrosine kinases in IR-induced G2/M checkpoint response in breast cancer cells. Results of the present studies indicate that irradiation exposure resulted in a striking increase in the phosphorylation of HER1, HER2, HER3 and HER4 in MCF-7 cells, indicative of activation of these proteins. Furthermore, specific inhibition of HER2 using an inhibitor, short hairpin RNA and dominant-negative mutant HER2 abolished IR-induced activation of ATM/and rad3-related signaling, phosphorylation of Cdc2-Y15 and subsequent induction of G2/M arrest. Moreover, the inhibition of HER2 also abrogated IR-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, inhibition of HER1 using specific inhibitors or decreasing expression of HER3 or HER4 using short hairpin RNAs did not block the induction of G2/M arrest following irradiation.

Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. To identify novel target genes that are related to liver carcinogenesis, we examined new genes that are differentially expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and tissues based on the expressed sequence tag frequency. Eleven libraries were constructed from seven hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and three normal liver tissue samples obtained from Korean patients. An analysis of gene expression profiles for hepatocellular carcinoma was performed using the frequency of ESTs obtained from these cDNA libraries. Genes were identified (n=120) as being either up- or down-regulated in human liver cancer cells. Among these, 14 genes (FTL, K-ALPHA1, LDHA, RPL4, ENO1, ANXA2, RPL9, RPL10, RPL13A, GNB2L1, AMBP, GC, A1BG, and SERPINC1), in addition to previously well-known liver cancer related genes, were confirmed to be differentially expressed in seven liver cancer cell lines and 17 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, 73 genes, in which there was a significant difference (P>0.99) between HBV- and HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma cells, were selected.

Insoluble intracellular aggregation of tau proteins into filaments and neurodegeneration are histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies. Recently, prefibrillar, soluble, oligomeric tau intermediates have emerged as relevant pathological tau species; Here, we show that hippocampal neurons in six-month-old transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, THY-Tau22, are enriched with oligomeric tau, contain elongated mitochondria, and display cellular stress, but no overt cytotoxicity compared to the control mice. The levels of several key mitochondrial proteins were markedly different between the THY-Tau22 and control mice hippocampi including the mitochondrial SIRT3, PINK1, ANT1 and the fission protein DRP1. DNA base excision repair is the primary defense system against oxidative DNA damage and it was elevated in six-month-old transgenic mice. DNA polymerase beta, the key base excision repair DNA polymerase, was enriched in the cytoplasm of hippocampal neurons in six-month-old transgenic mice and localized with and within mitochondria. Polbeta also co-localized with mitochondria in human alzheimer disease brains in neurons containing oligomeric tau. Most of these altered mitochondrial and DNA repair events were specific to the transgenic mice at 6___months of age and were not different from control mice at 12___months of age when tau pathology reaches its maximum and oligomeric forms of tau are no longer detectable.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of enteral application of an immunoglobulin enriched bovine milk preparation on endotoxin plasma levels, endotoxin neutralizing capacity of plasma (ENC) and the acute phase response (IL-6, CRP) during and after cardiac surgery, in a pilot study. DESIGN, PATIENTS AND METHODS: 60 patients who underwent coronary bypass operations, were evenly enrolled in a placebo-controlled randomized study. The patients were treated by enteral application of either 42 g of a bovine colostrum milk preparation per day or placebo, for 2 days preoperatively. Interleukin-6, CRP, transferrin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, albumin, apo-A, apo-B, IgG, IgA, IgM were determined by ELISA and nephelometrically. The clinical course was followed up by daily evaluation of the Apache-II-score. Endotoxin and ENC levels were elevated at the end of the operation and seemed to have a trigger function for the acute phase response. However, there was no reduction (calculated as the area under the curve) in patients receiving the colostrum milk preparation throughout the observation period. Plasma levels of endotoxin binding proteins did not differ. In the colostrum group, there was a tendency to reduced IL-6 levels throughout the observation period. CRP-levels of all patients peaked 48 h after the operation but were lower (p = 0.034) in the verum group. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that endotoxemia occurs early in an elective non-intestinal surgical intervention, and is followed by a subsequent increase in mediators of the acute phase reaction.

TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo- 2L), a newly identified member of the TNF family promotes apoptosis by binding to the transmembrane receptors (TRAIL-R1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/DR5). Tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand known to activate NF-kappaB in number of tumor cells including A549 (wt p53) and NCI-H1299 (null p53) lung cancer cells exerts relatively selective cytotoxic affects to the human tumor cell lines without much effect on the normal cells. We set out to identify an agent that would sensitize lung cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. We found that triptolide, an oxygenated diterpene extracted and purified from the Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii sensitized A549 and NCI-H1299 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Pretreatment with MG132 which is a well-known NF-kappaB inhibitor by blocking degradation of IkappaBalpha also greatly sensitized lung cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Triptolide did not block DNA binding of NF-kappaB activated by tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand as in the case of TNF-alpha.

Although an imbalance between mitochondrial fission and fusion has been identified as the cause of ischemic reperfusion injury, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. Augmenter of liver regeneration was reported to prevent mitochondrial fission by inhibiting dynamin-related protein 1 phosphorylation, contributing partially to its liver protection. Apart from phosphorylation, dynamin-related protein 1 activity is also regulated by small ubiquitin-like modification, which accelerates mitochondrial fission. This study aimed to investigate whether ALR-mediated protection from hepatic ischemic reperfusion injury might be associated with an effect on dynamin-related protein 1 small ubiquitin-like modification. Liver tissues were harvested from both humans and from heterozygous augmenter of liver regeneration knockout mice, which underwent ischemic reperfusion injury. The small ubiquitin-like modification and phosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 and their modulation by augmenter of liver regeneration were investigated. Hepatic dynamin-related protein 1 small ubiquitin-like modification was significantly increased in human transplanted livers and IRI-livers of mice. ALR-transfection significantly decreased dynamin-related protein 1 small ubiquitin-like modification, attenuated the IRI-induced mitochondrial fission and preserved mitochondrial stability and function. This study showed that the binding of transcription factor Yin Yang-1 to its downstream target gene UBA2, a subunit of SUMO-E1 enzyme heterodimer, was critical to control dynamin-related protein 1 small ubiquitin-like modification. By interacting with yin yang-1, augmenter of liver regeneration inhibits its nuclear import and dramatically decreases the transcriptional level of UBA2. Consequently, mitochondrial fission was significantly reduced, and mitochondrial function was maintained. This study showed that the regulation of dynamin-related protein 1 small ubiquitin-like modification by augmenter of liver regeneration protects mitochondria from fission, rescuing hepatocytes from IRI-induced apoptosis.

Introduction: The majority of desmoid-type fibromatosis tumors harbor a beta-catenin mutation, affecting specific codons in CTNNB1 exon 3. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of S45F and T41A mutated desmoid-type fibromatosis, to explain the observed differences in clinical behavior between these desmoid-type fibromatosis subtypes. Material and Methods: Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation was performed using MeD-seq on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary desmoid-type fibromatosis samples harboring a S45F (n = 14) or a T41A (n = 15) mutation. Protein-protein interactions between wild-type beta-catenin and mutant variants and DNA methyltransferase 1 were examined by immunoprecipitation experiments. Only ten differentially methylated regions displayed a fold change of ___1.5 and six of them were found associated with the following genes: NLRP4, FOXK2, PERM1, CCDC6, NOC4L, and DUX4L6. The effects of differentially methylated regions on gene expression yielded a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the expression between S45F and T41A for CCDC6 and FOXK2 but not for all Affymetrix probe-sets used to detect these genes. Immunoprecipitations did not reveal an association of wild-type beta-catenin or mutant variants with dna methyltransferase 1. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that S45F and T41A desmoid-type fibromatosis tumors did not exhibit gross differences in DNA methylation patterns.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of maternal obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus and adipokines on the expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake, transport, synthesis and metabolism. MATERIALS/METHODS: Human subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues were obtained from lean, overweight and obese normal glucose tolerant women and women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Adipose tissue explants were performed to determine the effect of the adipokines TNFalpha, IL-1beta and leptin on adipose tissue gene expression. RESULTS: Pre-existing maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus are associated with decreased expression in genes involved in fatty acid uptake and intracellular transport (LPL, FATP2, FATP6, FABPpm and ASCL1), triacylglyceride biosynthesis (MGAT1,7 MGAT2 and DGAT1), lipogenesis (FASN) and lipolysis (PNPLA2, HSL and MGLL). Decreased gene expression was also observed for the transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism (LXRalpha, PPARalpha, PPARdelta, PPARgamma, RXRalpha and SREBP1c). On the other hand, the gene expression of the adipokines TNFalpha, IL-1beta and or leptin was increased in adipose tissue from obese and gestational diabetes mellitus women. Functional in vitro studies revealed that these adipokines decreased the gene expression of LPL, FATP2, FATP6, ASCL1, PNPLA2, PPARdelta, PPARgamma and RXRalpha.

Studies show that arsenite induces oxidative stress and modifies cellular function via phosphorylation of proteins and inhibition of DNA repair enzymes. Autophagy, which has multiple physiological and pathological roles in cellular function, is initiated by oxidative stress and is regulated by the signaling pathways of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase /mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) and extracellular signaling-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) that play important roles in oncogenesis. However, the effects of arsenite-induced oxidative stress on autophagy and on expression of related proteins are not fully understood. This study found that cells treated with sodium arsenite had reduced 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) and increased 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and activating transcription factor 3 in SV-40 immortalized human uroepithelial (SV-HUC-1) cells. Arsenite also increased the number of autophagosomes and increased levels of the autophagy markers Beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B. Reactive oxygen species scavenger decreased arsenite-induced autophagy in SV-HUC-1 cells. Our previous work showed that arsenite induced phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The current study further showed that arsenite decreased phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) levels and increased phospho-p70S6 kinase in SV-HUC-1 cells. However, both kinase inhibitor U0126 and the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine abolished the effect of arsenite on expressions of PTEN and phospho-p70s6 kinase. These results show that autophagy induced by arsenite exposure is mediated by oxidative stress, which regulates activation of the PTEN, p70S6K and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Thus, this study clarifies the role of autophagy in arsenite-induced urothelial carcinogenesis.

Diethylstilbestrol capsules were implanted sc in immature hypophysectomized female rats; FSH was injected sc with or without test substance for 5 days. Rats with unstimulated ovaries were implanted with blank capsules and given the vehicle without FSH. The ovarian growth inhibition of the ovarian weight gain achieved in rats treated with diethylstilbestrol and FSH. Crude commercial human CG preparations, extracted from pregnancy urine, were chromatographed on Sephadex G-100, and the fractions were tested for ovarian growth inhibiting activity. Ovarian growth inhibiting activity was heat sensitive, not extracted by ether, and precipitated by acetone. Ovarian growth inhibiting activity was stable in acid at pH 2, but was inactivated by digestion with trypsin. The active material contained human cg alpha, human cg beta, and beta-carboxyterminal peptide-immunoreactivity and its inhibiting activity could be removed from solution by immunoadsorption with antisera specific for human cg beta. The activity was eluted from the affinity column at low pH, and eluted material contained all of the immunodeterminants of human cg. Virtually identical dose-response curves of ovarian inhibition were obtained using equivalent doses of beta-carboxyterminal peptide immunoreactivity of purified inhibitor and purified human cg (CR123). The inhibiting activity reached plateau of 80-90% at doses of 50-100 ng hCG/rat. Upon rechromatography on Sephadex G-100, the ovarian growth activity that was pooled from fractions corresponding to the 12,000-20,000 mol wt range was recovered in fractions corresponding to the elution position of human cg. We conclude that the low mol wt inhibiting activity observed in the crude pregnancy extracts is due to human cg and that human cg is a very potent inhibitor of FSH/diethylstilbestrol stimulation of ovarian growth.

FasL and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand belong to a subgroup of the TNF superfamily which induce apoptosis by binding to their death domain containing receptors. In the present study we have utilized a panel of seven cell lines derived from human malignant gliomas to characterize molecular pathways through which FasL and tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand induce apoptosis in sensitive glioma cells and the mechanisms of resistance in cell lines which survive the death stimuli. Our findings indicate that FADD and Caspase-8 are essential for FasL and tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand mediated apoptosis in glioma cells. One sensitive cell line (D270) can be protected from FasL and tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand induced death by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members while another (D645) cannot, implying that these lines may represent glioma examples of type II and type I cells respectively. For the first time we demonstrate resistance to FasL but not to tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand within the one glioma cell line.

502243 2A2847424 2A2680606	p40	Th1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 27780253 BACKGROUND: Interleukin -12 and IL-23 are heterodimers that share the p40 subunit, and both cytokines are critical in the differentiation of T helper 1 and Th17 cells, respectively. Th1 and Th17 effector cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalitis, an animal model of the human central nervous system autoimmune demyelinating disorder multiple sclerosis . However, ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody against p40 failed to show efficacy over placebo in a phase II clinical trial in patients with multiple sclerosis. The role of p40 in initial T cell priming and maintenance in secondary lymphoid tissues is not yet well understood. METHODS: Active experimental autoimmune encephalitis was induced in the B6.129-IL12b strain of p40eYFP reporter mice (yet40 mice), and Th1 and Th17 polarized cells were adoptively transferred into p40-deficient mice. Cellular subsets were phenotyped by multi-parameter flow cytometry, and p40 tissue expression was identified by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: We show that yet40 mice are susceptible to experimental autoimmune encephalitis, and that p40 is highly expressed in secondary lymphoid organs and the central nervous system during all stages of the disease. Interestingly, p40 expression in the recipient is not required for experimental autoimmune encephalitis induction after adoptive transfer of activated and differentiated encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17 cells into p40-deficient mice. Peripheral antagonism of T helper cell trophic factors critical for the differentiation and maintenance of Th1 and Th17 cells ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalitis, indicating that p40 may play a critical role in the induction of central nervous system autoimmunity but not in its perpetuation. CONCLUSION: Our data may explain why ustekinumab did not ameliorate paraclinical and clinical disease in patients with multiple sclerosis. In patients with already established disease, activated antigen-specific encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells are likely already differentiated, and are not dependent on p40 for maintenance.

Elevated blood and tissue CO(2), or hypercapnia, is common in severe lung disease. Patients with hypercapnia often develop lung infections and have an increased risk of death following pneumonia. To explore whether hypercapnia interferes with host defense, we studied the effects of elevated P(CO2) on macrophage innate immune responses. In differentiated human THP-1 macrophages and human and mouse alveolar macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and other Toll-like receptor ligands, hypercapnia inhibited expression of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin -6, nuclear factor -kappaB-dependent cytokines critical for antimicrobial host defense. Inhibition of IL-6 expression by hypercapnia was concentration dependent, rapid, reversible, and independent of extracellular and intracellular acidosis. In contrast, hypercapnia did not down-regulate IL-10 or interferon-beta, which do not require NF-kappaB. Notably, hypercapnia did not affect LPS-induced degradation of IkappaB alpha, nuclear translocation of RelA/p65, or activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, but it did block IL-6 promoter-driven luciferase activity in mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages. Elevated P(CO2) also decreased phagocytosis of opsonized polystyrene beads and heat-killed bacteria in THP-1 and human alveolar macrophages.

Background: Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in women worldwide. The purpose of this study was to identify the hub genes and construct prognostic signature that could predict the survival of patients with breast cancer . Drug-resistance hub genes were identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and a multigene risk model was constructed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis based on the TCGA cohort. Results: A 5-gene signature (GP6, MAK, DCTN2, TMEM156, and FKBP14) was constructed as a prognostic risk model. The nomogram comprising 5-gene signature showed better performance compared with other clinical features, Further, in the high-risk group, high M2 macrophage scores were related with bad prognosis, and the frequency of TP53 mutations was greater in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. In the low-risk group, high CD8+ T cell scores were associated with a good prognosis, and the frequency of CDH1 mutations was greater in the low-risk group than that in the high-risk group. At the same time, patients in the low risk group have a good response to immunotherapy in terms of immunotherapy. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that MAK, GP6, and TEMEM156 were significantly highly expressed in tumor tissues, and DCTN2 was highly expressed in normal tissues.

OBJECTIVE: The low prevalence of ovarian cancer demands both high sensitivity (>75%) and specificity (99.6%) to achieve a positive predictive value of 10% for successful early detection. We have attempted to improve sensitivity by combining CA125 with proteomic markers. METHODS: Sera from 41 patients with early stage (I/II) and 51 with late stage (III/IV) epithelial ovarian cancer, 40 with benign disease and 99 healthy individuals, were analyzed to measure 7 proteins [Apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1), truncated transthyretin, transferrin, hepcidin, _-2-microglobulin, Connective Tissue Activating Protein III, and Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 ]. RESULTS: In a training set analysis, the 3 most effective biomarkers (Apo-A1, truncated transthyretin and CTAPIII) exhibited 54% sensitivity at 98% specificity, CA125 alone produced 68% sensitivity and the combination increased sensitivity to 88%. In a validation set, the marker panel plus CA125 produced a sensitivity of 84% at 98% specificity (P=0.015, McNemar's test).

For real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) this commonly depends upon identification of stable (non-variable) endogenous reference genes, with housekeeping genes the most commonly used. In this report we describe the use of an external mRNA standard to identify stable housekeeping genes in the human fetal gonad. Total RNA was extracted from second trimester human fetal gonads and a standard amount of luciferase mRNA was added at the start of the extraction process. Levels of luciferase were then measured relative to each of seven housekeeping genes (SDHA, TBP, B2M, PMM1, SFRS4, HMBS and UBC) by RT-PCR. Measurement of overall variation in transcript expression showed that PMM1 was the most stable HKG in the ovary while B2M was most stable in the testis. This study describes a method for identification of endogenous, stable reference genes for RT-polymerase chain reaction studies of transcript expression levels which is objective and not dependent on prior assumptions of HKG expression. This technique is likely to be applicable to most tissues and, in this case, identifies suitable housekeeping genes for studies into human gonadal development.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [B2M protein] and [SFRS4 protein] interact with each other?

The polycomb repressive complex 2 maintains the transcriptional repression of target genes through its catalytic component enhancer of zeste homolog 2 . Through modulating critical gene expression, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 also plays a role in cancer development and progression by promoting cancer cell survival and invasion. Mutations in enhancer of zeste homolog 2 are prevalent in certain B-cell lymphoma subtypes such as diffuse large cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma; While no enhancer of zeste homolog 2 mutation has been reported in the mantle cell lymphoma . Here we demonstrate that the polycomb repressive complex 2 components enhancer of zeste homolog 2, EED and SUZ12 are upregulated in the mantle cell lymphoma cells as compared to normal B-cells. Moreover, stably transfected cells with wild-type enhancer of zeste homolog 2 or-EED showed increased cell growth and H3K27-trimehtylation. However, unlike wild-type enhancer of zeste homolog 2, ectopic expression of a deletion construct of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2delta550-738 lacking SET domain) had no growth advantage over control cells. Pharmacological inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 suppressed H3K27me3 and had significant inhibitory effect on cell growth and colony forming capacity (p < 0.05) of mantle cell lymphoma cells, and this effect was more or less comparable to the anti-proliferative effects of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 inhibition in cells harboring EZH2-mutation. Mechanistically, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 appears to downregulate expression of cdkn2b gene via enhanced H3K27me3, a well-known suppressive epigenetic mark, at the cdkn2b promoter region. Overall, these results highlight that deregulation of PRC2/enhancer of zeste homolog 2 is associated with epigenetic suppression of cdkn2b in mantle cell lymphoma, and in part responsible for increased cell growth, thus the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in the patients with mantle cell lymphoma.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [cdkn2b protein] and [enhancer of zeste homolog 2 protein] interact with each other?

BACKGROUND: Chemopreventive effects of zinc for esophageal cancer have been well documented in animal models. This prospective study explores if a similar, potentially chemopreventive action can be seen in Barrett's esophagus in humans. AIMS: To determine if molecular evidence can be obtained potentially indicating zinc's chemopreventive action in Barrett's metaplasia. METHODS: Patients with a prior barrett's esophagus diagnosis were placed on oral zinc gluconate (14 days of 26.4 mg zinc BID) or a sodium gluconate placebo, prior to their surveillance endoscopy procedure. These included downregulation of transcripts encoding proinflammatory proteins (IL32, IL1beta, IL15, IL7R, IL2R, IL15R, IL3R), upregulation of anti-inflammatory mediators (IL1RA), downregulation of transcripts mediating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (LIF, MYB, LYN, MTA1, SRC, SNAIL1, and TWIST1), and upregulation of transcripts that oppose epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (BMP7, MTSS1, TRIB3, GRHL1). MiRNA arrays showed significant upregulation of seven miRs with tumor suppressor activity (-125b-5P, -132-3P, -548z, -551a, -504, -518, and -34a-5P). Of proteins analyzed by Western blot, increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein, BAX, and the tight junctional protein, CLAUDIN-7, along with decreased expression of BCL-2 and VEGF-R2 were noteworthy. CONCLUSIONS: When these mRNA, miRNA, and protein molecular data are considered collectively, a cancer chemopreventive action by zinc in Barrett's metaplasia may be possible for this precancerous esophageal tissue.

Epithelioid sarcoma with a relative quiescent state of more than 10 years is extremely rare.Here, we present a rare case of epithelioid sarcoma in the forearm of a 17-year-old girl. The patient had a congenital mass in her forearm that measured approximately 1cm; The mass was located in the middle and lower part of the left forearm and involved the dorsal muscle group, intermuscular space, and subcutaneous tissues without clear boundaries.The patient underwent surgery, and the tumor recurred twice within 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS: Histopathologically, the tumor comprised large polygonal epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in cell nests. Central necrosis and focal myxoid change could be seen in the tumor tissues. Immunostaining showed that the tumor cells were positive for CD34, CK, EMA, and vimentin but negative for CD31, S-100, and INI-1.

Pyrrolizidine alkaloids initiate disease in the lung (pulmonary hypertension), liver (veno-occlusive disease and cirrhosis), and kidneys (afferent arteriolar block and mesangiolysis) by inducing a megalocytotic phenotype in target endothelial and parenchymal cells. A 'hit-and-run' type of exposure to the bioactive pyrrolizidine results, within 2-3 days, in enlarged cells with large nuclei and enlarged Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, while the cells remain in G2/M block. In the present study, we recapitulated monocrotaline pyrrole -induced megalocytosis in cultures of bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, human Hep3B hepatocytes, human type II-like alveolar epithelial cells (A549), and human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and investigated the subcellular mechanism involved. There was an inverse relationship between reduction in caveolin -1 levels and stimulation of promitogenic STAT3 and ERK1/2 cell signaling. In megalocytotic pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, the Golgi scaffolding protein GM130 was shifted from membranes with heavy density to those with a lighter density. This lighter Golgi fraction was enriched for hypo-oligomeric Cav-1, indicating dysfunctional trafficking of cargo. There was an increase in Ser25 phosphorylation of GM130 (typically a prelude to Golgi fragmentation and mitosis) and increased association between pGM130, cdc2 kinase, and Cav-1. Nevertheless, megalocytotic MCTP-treated cells showed reduced entry into mitosis upon stimulation with 2-methoxyestradiol, reduced 2-ME-induced Golgi fragmentation, and a slowing of Golgi reassembly after nocodazole-induced fragmentation.

Autoimmune pancreatitis is defined by characteristic lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, ductal strictures and a pancreatic enlargement or mass that can mimic pancreatic cancer . The distinction between this benign disease and pancreatic cancer can be challenging. However, an accurate diagnosis may pre-empt the misdiagnosis of cancer, allowing the appropriate medical treatment of autoimmune pancreatitis and, consequently, decreasing the number of unnecessary pancreatic resections. Mass spectrometry and two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) have been applied to analyse serum protein alterations associated with autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and to identify protein signatures indicative of the diseases. Patients' sera were immunodepleted from the 20 most prominent serum proteins prior to further 2D-DIGE and image analysis.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia is associated with PML-RARalpha oncogene, which is treated using all-trans retinoic acid -based chemotherapy. However, chemoresistance is observed in 20-30% of treated patients and represents a clinical challenge, raising the importance of the development of new therapeutic options. In the present study, the effects of three synthetic cyclopenta[b]indoles on the leukemia phenotype were investigated using NB4 (ATRA-sensitive) and NB4-R2 (ATRA-resistant) cells. Among the tested synthetic cyclopenta[b]indoles, compound 2, which contains a heterocyclic nucleus, was the most active, presenting time-dependent cytotoxic activity in the muM range in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, without cytotoxicity for normal leukocytes, and was selected for further characterization. Compound 2 significantly decreased clonogenicity, increased apoptosis, and caused cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases in a drug concentration-dependent manner. Morphological analyses indicated aberrant mitosis and diffuse tubulin staining upon compound 2 exposure, which corroborates cell cycle findings. In the molecular scenario, compound 2 reduced STMN1 expression and activity, and induced PARP1 cleavage and H2AX and CHK2 phosphorylation, and modulated CDKN1A, PMAIP1, GADD45A, and XRCC3 expressions, indicating reduction of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA damage.

Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin can be generally classified into deletional and nondeletional forms. The family described in the present study has characteristics of both types of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. The proband is a healthy 30-year-old black woman. Analysis of her hemoglobin revealed 40.4% HbS, 40.9% HbF (G gamma/A gamma ratio 0.53), 16.8% HbA, and 1.9% HbA2.

The human 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (DS) is caused by a heterozygous microdeletion affecting six genes: FAN1; MTMR10; TRPM1; KLF13; OTUD7A; And CHRNA7. Carriers are at risk for intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Here we used the Df[h15q13]/+ mouse model with an orthologous deletion to further characterize molecular, neurophysiological, and behavioral parameters that are relevant to the 15q13.3 DS. First, we verified the expression and distribution of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a gene product of the CHRNA7, in cortical and subcortical areas. Results revealed similar mRNA distribution pattern in wildtype and heterozygous mice, with about half the number of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding sites in mutants. Hippocampal recordings showed similar input/output responses of field excitatory post-synaptic potentials and theta-burst induced long-term potentiation in wildtype and heterozygous mice. Heterozygous males exhibited impaired spatial learning acquisition in the Barnes Maze. Indicative of increased seizure susceptibility, heterozygous mice developed secondary seizures after 6-Hz corneal stimulation, and had significantly increased sensitivity to the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol resulting in increased spiking in hippocampal EEG recordings. Basal mRNA expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor and activity regulated immediate early genes (c-fos, Arc, Erg-1 and Npas4) during adolescence, a critical period of brain maturation, was unaffected by genotype. Thus, the microdeletion did not show gross neuroanatomical, molecular, and neurophysiological abnormalities despite deficits in spatial learning and increased susceptibility to seizures.

To evaluate the presumed peroxisomal involvement in cholesterol/isoprenoid biosynthesis, we determined the protein levels and activities of five different enzymes of the presqualene segment of the cholesterol/isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in primary skin fibroblasts of selected patients with a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder . These five enzymes all have been reported to be partly or exclusively peroxisomal and include HMG-CoA reductase, mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase, and isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase. To exclude that genetic differences, resulting in different defects in peroxisomal biogenesis, have differential effects on the activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes and on de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, we chose fibroblasts of patients with defined defects in one of four different PEX genes leading to Zellweger syndrome (PEX1, PEX5, PEX16 or PEX19). We found that all enzymes measured are at least as active in the peroxisome-deficient cells cultured in cholesterol-depleted medium as in identically cultured control cells. This indicates that if these presumed peroxisomal proteins are mislocalized to the cytosol they do not loose their activity, nor get degraded unlike most other authentic peroxisomal proteins.

Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid childhood tumor. Despite the availability of advanced multimodal therapy, high-risk patients still have low survival rates. p21-activated kinase 4 has been shown to regulate many cellular processes in cancer cells, including migration, polarization and proliferation. However, the role of p21-activated kinase 4 in neuroblastoma remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that p21-activated kinase 4 was overexpressed in neuroblastoma tissues and was correlated with tumor malignance and prognosis. To investigate the function of p21-activated kinase 4 in neuroblastoma, we used a small-molecule inhibitor that targets p21-activated kinase 4, that is, PF-3758309. Our results showed that PF-3758309 significantly induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines. Meanwhile, the inhibition of p21-activated kinase 4 by PF-3758309 increased the expression of CDKN1A, BAD and BAK1 and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax. In addition, we screened the target genes of p21-activated kinase 4 by PCR array and found that 23 genes were upregulated (including TP53I3, TBX3, EEF1A2, CDKN1A, IFNB1 and MAPK8IP2) and 20 genes were downregulated (including TNFSF8, Bcl2-A1, Bcl2L1, SOCS3, BIRC3 and NFKB1) after p21-activated kinase 4 inhibition by PF-3758309. Moreover, p21-activated kinase 4 was found to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis via the ERK signaling pathway.

However, the global impact of microplastic on human health is by and large either unknown or neglected. By looking at the underlying biochemical mechanisms leading to the global health threat microplastic was discovered to carry persistent organic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, to marine life. The effect of microplastic-ingestion in the human body remains unfortunately somewhat elusive as of yet. For this reason, we screened for compounds binding to the human estrogen receptor alpha and identified the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons compounds indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and picene with a high binding affinity. We applied next generation sequencing to analyze the differentially expressed genes in MCF-7 cells after treatment with indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and picene. We found 8 upregulated genes: ABCC5, CCNG2, CYP1A1, DDIT4, IER3, RUNX2, STC2, and SLC7A5 and 14 downregulated genes: ADORA1, CEBPB, CELSR2, CTSD, CXCL12, KRT19, PGR, PKIB, RARA, RET, SEMA3B, SIAH2, TFAP2C, and XBP1 induced by both ligands and associated with ESR1-regulation.

AIM: By using comparative genomic hybridization, gain of 3q was found in 45-86% cases of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma . Chromosome 3q25.3-qter is the minimal common region with several oncogenes found within this region. However, amplification patterns of these genes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma have never been reported. METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to analyze the copy number changes of 13 candidate genes within this region in 60 primary tumors of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and possible association of copy number changes with pathologic characteristics was analyzed by statistics. Immunohistochemistry study was also performed on another set of 111 primary tumors of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to verify the association between TP63 expression change and lymph node metastasis status. RESULTS: The average copy numbers (+/-SE) per haploid genome of individual genes in 60 samples were (from centromere to telomere): SSR3: 4.19 (+/-0.69); CCNL1: 5.24 (+/-0.67); SMC4L1: 2.01 (+/-0.16); EVI1: 2.02 (+/-0.12); EIF5A2: 1.95 (+/-0.12); ECT2: 9.18 (+/-1.68); PIK3CA: 8.13 (+/-1.17); EIF4G1: 1.07 (+/-0.05); SST: 3.07 (+/-0.25); TP63: 2.51 (+/-0.22); Four clusters of amplification were found: SSR3 and CCLN1 at 3q25.31; ECT2 and PIK3CA at 3q26.31-q26.32; And SST, TP63 and TFRC at 3q27.3-q29. Patients with lymph node metastasis had significantly lower copy number of TP63 in the primary tumor than those without lymph node metastasis. Immunohistochemistry study on tissue arrays also showed that patients with lymph node metastasis have significantly lower TP63 staining score in the primary tumor than those without lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSION: This study showed that different amplification patterns were seen among different genes within 3q25.3-qter in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and several novel candidate oncogenes (SSR3, SMC4L1, ECT2, and SST) were identified.

Because of the known property of spontaneous regression in stage IVS of neuroblastoma all attempts are made to elucidate whether differentiation inducers possibly could be applied for neuroblastoma therapy. Here we examined the influence of retinoic acid in vitro on differentiation, proliferation and adhesion of 10 permanent and 4 primary cell lines as well as of several SCID-mouse tumour transplants. In general, after retinoic acid treatment morphologically different cell types which are characteristic for neuroblastoma cells have changed. N (neuronal)-type cells prolonged their neuronal processes, whereas S (epithelial, substrate-adherent, Schwann cell-like)-type cells lost their adherence to substratum and became apoptotic. Additionally, the reactions of all neuroblastoma cell lines with monoclonal antibodies against beta-tubulin (for neuronal cells) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (for epithelial cells) were determined. The anti-proliferative effect of all-trans-retinoic acid as well as 13-cis-RA was more profound in S-type cells (up to 40% in primary cell lines). To elucidate the role of adhesion molecules during neuronal cell differentiation, we have analysed the adhesion of neuroblastoma cells on poly-D-lysin-precoated plates under retinoic acid influence. While N-type cells displayed an increased adhesion, all S-type cell lines as well as all primary cell lines exhibited a reduced adhesion (IMR-5 and IMR-32: p < 0.001; JW, SR and PM: p < 0.05). Retinoic acid treatment increased predominantly the tested antigens (HCAM, ICAM-1, NCAM, PECAM-1, VCAM-1, cadherin, FGF-R, IGF-R, NGF-R, TGF-beta/1, NF200, NF160, NF68, NSE, HLA-ABC) in all cell lines independently of their phenotypes (TGF-beta/1: p < 0.001; NF68: p < 0.01; PECAM-1 and NGF-R: p < 0.05). In recultured SCID-mouse-passaged tumour cells antigens were down-regulated (FGF-R: p < 0.01), but increased again after retinoic acid influence (TGF-beta/1: p < 0.05). In summary, the retinoic acid differentiation model demonstrates the possibility to interfere in cell adhesion and to diminish growth potential both in N-type as well as S-type neuroblastoma cells.

On another hand, several genes involved in familial forms of neurodegenerative diseases exert key innate immune functions. First, we retrieved the expression patterns of common neurodegeneration-associated proteins in two professional antigen-presenting cells, namely B lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Surprisingly, we found that under physiological conditions, numerous neurodegeneration-associated proteins are abundantly expressed by human B lymphocytes. A survey of the human proteome allowed us to map a unique protein-protein interaction network linking common neurodegeneration-associated proteins and their first shell interactors in human B lymphocytes. Interestingly, network connectivity analysis identified two major hubs that both relate with inflammation and autophagy, namely TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6 and Sequestosome-1 . Moreover, the mapped network in B lymphocytes comprised two additional hub proteins involved in both inflammation and autoimmunity: HSPA8 (Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 8 also known as HSC70) and HSP90AA1 (Heat Shock Protein 90 Alpha Family Class A Member 1). Based on these results, we then explored the Immune Epitope Database 'IEDB-AR' and actually found that a large share of neurodegeneration-associated proteins were previously reported to provide endogenous MHC class II-binding peptides in human B lymphocytes. Of note, peptides deriving from amyloid beta A4 protein, sequestosome-1 or profilin-1 were reported to bind multiple allele-specific MHC class II molecules. In contrast, peptides deriving from microtubule-associated protein tau, presenilin 2 and serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1 were exclusively reported to bind MHC molecules encoded by the HLA-DRB1 1501 allele, a recently-identified susceptibility gene for late onset Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we observed that the whole list of proteins reported to provide endogenous MHC class II-binding peptides in human B lymphocytes is specifically enriched in neurodegeneration-associated proteins. Overall, our work indicates that immunization against neurodegeneration-associated proteins might be a physiological process which is shaped, at least in part, by B lymphocytes.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Sequestosome-1 protein] and [profilin-1 protein] interact with each other?

This study aimed to determine the gene expression profile of these lesions and potential biomarkers for closed-cervix pyometra, the most severe condition. Total RNA was extracted from 69 fresh endometrium samples collected from 21 healthy female dogs during diestrus, 16 cystic endometrial hyperplasia, 15 mucometra and 17 pyometra (eight open and nine closed-cervixes). Unsupervised analysis revealed two clusters, one mainly composed of diestrus and cystic endometrial hyperplasia samples and the other by 12/15 mucometra and all pyometra samples. When comparing pyometra with other groups, 189 differentially expressed genes were detected. SLPI, PTGS2/COX2, MMP1, S100A8, S100A9 and IL8 were among the top up-regulated genes detected in pyometra, further confirmed by external expression data. Notably, a particular molecular profile in pyometra from animals previously treated with exogenous progesterone compounds was observed in comparison with pyometra from untreated dogs as well as with other groups irrespective of exogenous hormone treatment status. In addition to S100A8 and S100A9 genes, overexpression of the inflammatory cytokines IL1B, TNF and IL6 as well as LTF were detected in the pyometra from treated animals. Interestingly, closed pyometra was more frequently detected in treated dogs (64% versus 33%), with IL1B, TNF, LBP and CXCL10 among the most relevant overexpressed genes. This molecular signature associated with potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, such as CXCL10 and COX2, should guide future clinical studies.

Through the secretion of parathyroid hormone, the parathyroid glands are primarily responsible for maintaining extracellular calcium and phosphorus concentrations. Hypercalcemia may be distinguished in parathyroid-hypercalcemia and nonparathyroid hypercalcemia. The most common disorders include primary hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, granulomatous diseases, and medications. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a disease characterized by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly due to a single benign parathyroid adenoma (80%) and with multiglandular disease seen in approximately 15-20% of patients. Primary hyperparathyroidism is due to multiglandular involvement consisting of either multiple adenomas or hyperplasia of all 4 glands (5-10%), and very rarely parathyroid carcinoma (<1%). In most patients the disease is sporadic, without a personal or family history of primary hyperparathyroidism. The genetic syndromes associated with primary hyperparathyroidism include multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, MEN2A, and MEN4, hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, familial isolated primary hyperparathyroidism, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism.

BACKGROUND: Recently, we have shown anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of indicaxanthin associated with epigenetic modulation of the onco-suppressor p16INK4a in the human colon cancer cell line CACO2. In the present study, the epigenetic activity of indicaxanthin and the mechanisms involved were further investigated in other colorectal cancer cell lines. METHODS: LOVO1, CACO2, HT29, HCT116, and DLD1 cells were used to evaluate the potential influence of consistent dietary concentrations of indicaxanthin on DNA methylation, and the epigenetic mechanisms involved were researched. RESULTS: Indicaxanthin exhibited anti-proliferative activity in all cell lines but HT29, induced demethylation in the promoters of some methylation-silenced onco-suppressor genes involved in colorectal carcinogenesis (p16INK4a, GATA4, and ESR1), and left unchanged others which were basally hypermethylated (SFRP1 and HPP1). In apparent contrast, cell exposure to indicaxanthin increased DNMT gene expression, although indicaxanthin appeared to be an inhibitor of DNMT activity. Indicaxanthin also increased the expression of genes involved in DNA demethylation. Finally, an in silico molecular modelling approach suggested stable binding of indicaxanthin at the DNMT1 catalytic site.

Although elevated HSP70 levels have been identified in rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissues and rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid compared with patients with osteoarthritis and healthy individuals, it remains unclear what role extracellular HSP70 plays in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of extracellular HSP70 on the production of RA-associated cytokines in fibroblast-like synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. METHODS: IL-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 levels in culture supernatants were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, was detected using Western blotting. RESULTS: Human HSP70 downregulated IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 production in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes induced by tumour necrosis factor -alpha in a concentration dependent manner. HSP70 inhibited the activation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK in fibroblast-like synoviocytes stimulated by TNF-alpha. Furthermore, HSP70 also significantly inhibited nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB and degradation of IkappaBalpha induced by TNF-alpha. CONCLUSION: Extracellular HSP70 has an anti-inflammatory effect on rheumatoid arthritis by downregulating production of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes, which is mediated through inhibited activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappab signal pathways.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [HSP70 protein] and [IkappaBalpha protein] interact with each other?

The activating transcription factor 4 promotes transcriptional upregulation of specific target genes in response to cellular stress. Activating transcription factor 4 expression is regulated at the translational level by two short open reading frames (uORFs) in its 5'-untranslated region . Here, we describe a mechanism regulating activating transcription factor 4 expression in translation termination-deficient human cells. Using microarray analysis of total RNA and polysome-associated mRNAs, we show that depletion of the eucaryotic release factor 3a induces upregulation of activating transcription factor 4 and of activating transcription factor 4 target genes. We show that eucaryotic release factor 3a depletion modifies activating transcription factor 4 translational control at regulatory uORFs increasing activating transcription factor 4 ORF translation. Finally, we show that the increase of REDD1 expression, one of the upregulated targets of activating transcription factor 4, is responsible for the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway inhibition in eRF3a-depleted cells. Our results shed light on the molecular mechanisms connecting eucaryotic release factor 3a depletion to mammalian target of rapamycin pathway inhibition and give an example of activating transcription factor 4 activation that bypasses the signal transduction cascade leading to the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha.

High-order interactions among reflux, body mass index, smoking, and functional polymorphisms in five apoptotic genes (FAS, FASL, IL1B, TP53BP, and BAT3) were investigated by entropy-based multifactor dimensionality reduction, classification and regression tree, and traditional logistic regression models. However, there was a two-way interaction between IL1B + 3954C>T and reflux (P = .008). In individuals with reflux symptoms, classification and regression tree analysis indicated that strongest interaction was among variant genotypes of IL1B + 3954C>T and BAT3S625P, higher body mass index, and smoking (odds ratio [OR], 5.76; 95% CI, 2.48 to 13.38), a finding independently found using multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis. Gene-environment interaction patterns differ between patients with and without reflux symptoms.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [BAT3 protein] and [FAS protein] interact with each other?

If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone." [YES, high confidence] Explanation: ...; Non-interacting: "While both drugs are used to induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and subsequently EBV reactivation, there is no direct interaction mentioned between pevonedistat and Desferal.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, high confidence; Explanation: The provided context discusses interactions among genetic variants in apoptosis pathway genes, reflux symptoms, body mass index, and smoking, but it does not mention any direct interaction between the BAT3 protein and the FAS protein. Instead, it focuses on the interactions between specific genetic variants and environmental factors, such as reflux symptoms, body mass index, and smoking, in relation to esophageal adenocarcinoma development. Therefore, there is no evidence in the context to suggest that the BAT3 protein and the FAS protein interact with each other.</s>

BACKGROUND: MetastamiRs have momentous clinical relevance and have been correlated with disease progression in many tumors. In this study, we identified neuroblastoma metastamiRs exploiting unique mouse models of favorable and high-risk metastatic human neuroblastoma. Further, we related their deregulation to the modulation of target proteins and established their association with clinical outcomes. Immunoblotting and TMA-IHC analyses revealed alterations in the expression/phosphorylation of metastamiRs' targets, including ADAMTS-1, AKT1/2/3, ASK1, AURKbeta, Birc1, Birc2, Bric5, beta-CATENIN, CASP8, CD54, CDK4, CREB, CTGF, CXCR4, CYCLIN-D1, EGFR, ELK1, ESR1, CFOS, FOSB, FRA, GRB10, GSK3beta, IL1alpha, JUND, kRAS, KRTAP1, MCP1, MEGF10, MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, MMP10, MTA2, MYB, cMYC, NF2, NOS3, P21, pP38, PTPN3, CLEAVED PARP, PKC, SDF-1beta, SEMA3D, SELE, STAT3, TLR3, TNFalpha, TNFR1, and VEGF in aggressive cells ex vivo and in a manifold of metastatic tumors in vivo. MiRNA mimic (hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-27b, hsa-miR-93, hsa-miR-20a) and inhibitor (hsa-miR-1224-3p, hsa-miR-1260) approach for select miRNAs revealed the direct influence of the altered metastamiRs in the regulation of identified protein targets. Clinical outcome association analysis with the validated metastamiRs' targets corresponded strongly with poor overall and relapse-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, these results identified a comprehensive list of neuroblastoma metastamiRs, related their deregulation to altered expression of protein targets, and established their association with poor clinical outcomes. The identified set of distinctive neuroblastoma metastamiRs could serve as potential candidates for diagnostic markers for the switch from favorable to high-risk metastatic disease.

Chemotherapeutic drug resistance is a major clinical problem and cause for failure in the therapy of human cancer. One of the goals of molecular oncology is to identify the underlying mechanisms, with the hope that more effective therapies can be developed. Several mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to chemoresistance: 1) amplification or overexpression of the P-glycoprotein family of membrane transporters (eg, MDR1, MRP, LRP) which decrease the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapy; 2) changes in cellular proteins involved in detoxification (eg, glutathione S-transferase pi, metallothioneins, human MutT homologue, bleomycin hydrolase, dihydrofolate reductase) or activation of the chemotherapeutic drugs (DT-diaphorase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate:cytochrome P-450 reductase); 3) changes in molecules involved in DNA repair (eg, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, DNA topoisomerase II, hMLH1, p21WAF1/CIP1; 4) activation of oncogenes such as Her-2/neu, bcl-2, bcl-XL, c-myc, ras, c-jun, c-fos, MDM2, p210 BCR-abl, or mutant p53.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [LRP protein] and [bleomycin hydrolase protein] interact with each other?

Development of ketosis in high-producing dairy cows contributes to several animal health issues and highlights the need for a better understanding of the genetic basis of metabolic diseases. To evaluate the pattern of differential gene expression in the liver of cows under negative energy balance, and under subclinical and clinical ketosis, a meta-analysis of gene expression and genome-wide association studies results was performed. An initial systematic review identified 118 articles based on the key words 'cow,' 'liver,' 'negative energy balance,' 'ketosis,' 'expression,' 'qPCR,' 'microarray,' 'proteomic,' 'RNA-Seq,' and 'GWAS.' After further screening for only peer-reviewed and pertinent articles for gene expression during negative energy balance and clinical and subclinical ketosis (considering plasma levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate), 20 articles were included in the analysis. From the systematic review, 430 significant SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies were assigned to genes reported in gene expression studies by considering chromosome and base pair positions in the ARS-UCD 1.2 bovine assembly. Three significant metabolic pathways were associated with negative energy balance and subclinical and clinical ketosis. In addition, 2 important genes, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase alpha, were identified, which were differentially expressed in the 3 metabolic conditions. The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha gene is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and fatty liver disease and the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase alpha gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-coenzyme A to malonyl-coenzyme A, which is a rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. Gene network analysis revealed co-expression interactions among 34 genes associated with functions involving fatty acid transport and fatty acid metabolism. For the annotated QTL, 9 QTL were identified for ketosis. The genes fibronectin 1 and protein tyrosine kinase 2, which are mainly involved in cell adhesion and formation of extracellular matrix constituents, were enriched for QTL previously associated with the trait 'ketosis' on chromosome 2 and for the trait 'milk iron content' on chromosome 14, respectively. This integration of gene expression and genome-wide association studies data provides an additional understanding of the genetic background of negative energy balance and subclinical and clinical ketosis in dairy cattle. Thus, it is a useful approach to identify biological mechanisms underlying these metabolic conditions in dairy cattle.

In a preliminary study we have investigated the role of lymphatic vessels growth in 19 cases of classical Hodgkin lymphoma stained with the D2-40 (podoplanin) antibody.

Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic disease of the joint; However, the therapeutic options for severe osteoarthritis are limited. The low molecular weight fraction of commercial 5% human serum albumin (LMWF5A) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties that are mediated, in part, by a diketopiperazine that is present in the albumin preparation and that was demonstrated to be safe and effective in reducing pain and improving function when administered intra-articularly in a phase III clinical trial. In the present study, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells exposed to LMWF5A exhibited an elongated phenotype with diffuse intracellular F-actin, pronounced migratory leading edges, and filopodia-like projections. In addition, LMWF5A promoted chondrogenic condensation in 'micromass' culture, concurrent with the upregulation of collagen 2alpha1 mRNA. Several transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation were also found to bind oligonucleotide response element probes following exposure to LMWF5A. Finally, a rapid increase in PRAS40 phosphorylation was observed following treatment, potentially resulting in the activation mTORC1. Proteomic analysis of synovial fluid taken from a preliminary set of patients indicated that at 12 weeks following administration of LMWF5A, a microenvironment exists in the knee conducive to stem cell infiltration, self-renewal, and differentiation, in addition to indications of remodeling with a reduction in inflammation. Taken together, these findings imply that LMWF5A treatment may prime stem cells for both mobilization and chondrogenic differentiation, potentially explaining some of the beneficial effects achieved in clinical trials.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [PRAS40 protein] and [Albumin protein] interact with each other?

Antimony (Sb), a naturally occurring metal present in air and drinking water, has been found in the human brain, and there is evidence of its toxic effects on neurobehavioral perturbations, suggesting that Sb is a potential nerve poison. Here, we provide the first study on the molecular mechanism underlying Sb-associated neurotoxicity. Mice exposed to antimony potassium tartrate hydrate showed significantly increased neuronal apoptosis. In vitro, Sb triggered apoptosis in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanically, Sb triggered autophagy as indicated by increased expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II and accumulation of green fluorescent protein-tagged LC3 dots. Moreover, Sb enhanced autophagic flux and sequestosome 1 (p62) degradation. Subsequent analyses showed that Sb treatment decreased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) as well as the mammalian target of rapamycin, while an Akt activator protected PC12 cells from autophagy. Moreover, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine attenuated Sb-induced Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition and decreased autophagy and apoptosis, with autophagy inhibition also playing a cytoprotective role.

Carbendazim is one of the most widespread environmental contaminant that can cause major concern to human and animal reproductive system. To date, very few studies have been conducted on the toxic effect of carbendazim in the non-target organism zebrafish (Danio rerio). The study presented here aimed to assess how carbendazim triggers apoptosis, immunotoxicity and endocrine disruption pathways in zebrafish during its embryo development. Our results demonstrated that the expression patterns of many key genes involved in cell apoptosis pathway (e.g. P53, Mdm2, Bbc3 and Cas8) were significantly up-regulated upon the exposure to carbendazim at the concentration of 500 mug/L, while the Bcl2 and Cas3 were down-regulated at the same concentration, interestingly, the expression level of Ogg1 decreased at all the exposure concentrations.

BACKGROUND: The storage capacity of adipose tissue may be an important factor linking obesity, insulin resistance, and associated morbidities. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of lipogenic and lipolytic genes in adipose tissue and the influence of insulin resistance. METHODS: We studied the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and lipogenic and lipolytic enzymes in the visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue from 23 morbidly obese patients (MO; 13 with low insulin resistance and ten with high IR) and from 15 healthy, lean controls. RESULTS: In the visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue from the MO, we found an increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (p___=___0.001 and p___=___0.022, respectively), acyl-coenzyme A /cholesterol acyltransferase (p___<___0.001 and p___<___0.001), aquaporin 7 (p___<___0.001 and p___=___0.003), and adipose triglyceride lipase (p___<___0.001 and p___<___0.001) and a reduced expression of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (p___=___0.004 and p___<___0.001), independently of the state of insulin resistance.

OBJECTIVES: Mechanisms of toxicity and cell damage were investigated in novel clonal human pancreatic beta cell line, 1.1B4, after exposure to streptozotocin, alloxan, ninhydrin, and hydrogen peroxide. METHODS: Viability, DNA damage, insulin secretion/content, [Ca]i, and glucokinase/hexokinase, mRNA expression were measured by MTT assay, comet assay, radioimmunoassay, fluorometric imaging plate reader, enzyme-coupled photometry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Chronic 18-hour exposure decreased cellular insulin, glucokinase, and hexokinase activities. Chemicals decreased transcription of INS, GCK, PCSK1, PCSK2, and GJA1 (involved in secretory function). Insulin release and [Ca]i responses to nutrients and membrane-depolarizing agents were impaired. Streptozotocin and alloxan up-regulated transcription of genes, SOD1 and SOD2 (antioxidant enzymes). Ninhydrin and hydrogen peroxide up-regulated SOD2 transcription, whereas alloxan and hydrogen peroxide increased CAT transcription. Chemicals induced DNA damage, apoptosis, and increased caspase 3/7 activity. Streptozotocin and alloxan decreased transcription of BCL2 while increasing transcription of BAX.

Somatic motor neurons are selectively vulnerable in spinal muscular atrophy, which is caused by a deficiency of the ubiquitously expressed survival of motor neuron protein. However, some motor neuron groups, including oculomotor and trochlear (ocular), which innervate eye muscles, are for unknown reasons spared. To reveal mechanisms of vulnerability and resistance in spinal muscular atrophy, we investigate the transcriptional dynamics in discrete neuronal populations using laser capture microdissection coupled with RNA sequencing (LCM-seq). Using gene correlation network analysis, we reveal a TRP53-mediated stress response that is intrinsic to all somatic motor neurons independent of their vulnerability, but absent in relatively resistant red nucleus and visceral motor neurons. However, the temporal and spatial expression analysis across neuron types shows that the majority of SMA-induced modulations are cell type-specific. Using Gene Ontology and protein network analyses, we show that ocular motor neurons present unique disease-adaptation mechanisms that could explain their resilience. Specifically, ocular motor neurons up-regulate (1) Syt1, Syt5, and Cplx2, which modulate neurotransmitter release; (2) the neuronal survival factors Gdf15, Chl1, and Lif; (3) Aldh4, that protects cells from oxidative stress; And (4) the caspase inhibitor Pak4. Finally, we show that GDF15 can rescue vulnerable human spinal motor neurons from degeneration. This confirms that adaptation mechanisms identified in resilient neurons can be used to reduce susceptibility of vulnerable neurons. In conclusion, this in-depth longitudinal transcriptomics analysis in spinal muscular atrophy reveals novel cell type-specific changes that, alone and combined, present compelling targets, including Gdf15, for future gene therapy studies aimed toward preserving vulnerable motor neurons.

'Microtubule-associated protein tau' (MAPT), 'granulin' (GRN) and 'chromosome 9 open reading frame72' (C9ORF72) gene mutations are the major known genetic causes of frontotemporal dementia . Recent studies suggest that mutations in these genes may also be associated with other forms of dementia. Therefore we investigated whether MAPT, GRN and C9ORF72 gene mutations are major contributors to dementia in a random, unselected Turkish cohort of dementia patients.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an infection caused by Leishmania (L.) protozoa transmitted through the bite of infected sand fly. Previously, invasive sampling of blood and skin along with low throughput methods were used for determination of inflammatory response in cutaneous leishmaniasis patients. AIMS/METHODOLOGY: We established a novel approach based on a non-invasive adhesive tape-disc sampling combined with a powerful multiplexing technique called proximity extension assay for profiling 92 inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and surface molecules in the lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis patients infected with L. tropica. Sample collection was done non-invasively by using adhesive tape-discs from lesion and normal skin of 33 L. tropica positive patients. RESULTS: Out of 92 inflammatory proteins, the level of 34 proteins was significantly increased in the lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis patients compared to their normal skin. This includes the chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, together with the interleukins IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, LIF and OSM. The remaining significantly changed inflammatory proteins include 7 surface molecules and receptors: CD5, CD40, CDCP1, 4E-BP1, TNFRSF9, IL-18R1 and OPG as well as 16 other cytokines and proteins: MMP-1, CSF-1, VEGFA, uPA, EN-RAGE, LAP TGF-beta1, HGF, MMP-10, CASP-8, TNFSF14, STAMPB, ADA, TRAIL and ST1A1. Further, 13 proteins showed an increasing trend, albeit not statistically significant, in the cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions, including TGF-alpha, CCL23, MCP-2, IL-12B, CXCL6, IL-24, FGF-19, TNFbeta, CD6, TRANCE, IL10, SIR2 and CCL20. CONCLUSION: We herein report a novel approach based on a non-invasive sampling method combined with the high-throughput protein assay for profiling inflammatory proteins in cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions.

Background: Prostate adenocarcinoma is a common malignant tumor in elderly men. Our research uses The Cancer Gene Atlas database to find potential related genes for predicting the prognosis of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma. Methods: We downloaded gene expression profiles and clinical sample information from the cancer gene atlas for 490 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (patient age: 41-78 years). We categorized patients with prostate adenocarcinoma in the cancer gene atlas into high and low score arrays according to their median immune/stromal scores and identified differentially expressed genes that were significantly correlated with the prognosis of prostate adenocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Differentiation of pluripotent stem cells in vitro provides a powerful means to investigate early developmental fates, including hematopoiesis. Our goal was to induce in vitro, the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells into morphologically and phenotypically mature leukocytes and erythrocytes, in the complete absence of serum and feeder cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells were sequentially induced in liquid cultures for 4 days with bone morphogenic protein-4, and for 4 days with FLT3-ligand, stem cell factor, thrombopoietin and vascular endothelium growth factor. Cell differentiation status was investigated by both mRNA expression and FACS expression profiles. In liquid cultures, cells progressively down-modulated Oct-4 expression while a sizeable cell fraction expressed CD34 de novo. SCL/Tal1 and Runx1 transcripts were exclusively detected in CD34(+) cells. In clonal assays, both embryonic stem cells and iPSC-derived cells generated colony-forming unit, albeit with a 150-fold lower efficacy than cord blood CD34(+) cells. ESC-derived CD34(+) cells generated myeloid and fully hemoglobinized erythroid cells whereas CD34(-) cells almost exclusively generated small erythroid colonies. Both embryonic stem cells and iPSC-derived erythroid cells expressed embryonic and fetal globins but were unable to synthesize adult beta-globin in contrast with cord blood cells, suggesting that they had differentiated from primitive rather than from definitive hematopoietic progenitors.

174054 2A2735098 2A2906436	peptidylprolyl isomerase A	TOMM20	[INST]Context: [PMID: 35220898 Autophagy deficiency abolishes liver mitochondrial DNA segregation. Mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) are ubiquitous in humans and can lead to a broad spectrum of disorders. However, due to the presence of multiple mtDNA molecules in the cell, co-existence of mutant and wild-type mtDNAs (termed heteroplasmy) can mask disease phenotype unless a threshold of mutant molecules is reached. Importantly, the mutant mtDNA level can change across lifespan as mtDNA segregates in an allele- and cell-specific fashion, potentially leading to disease. Segregation of mtDNA is mainly evident in hepatic cells, resulting in an age-dependent increase of mtDNA variants, including non-synonymous potentially deleterious mutations. Here we modeled mtDNA segregation using a well-established heteroplasmic mouse line with mtDNA of NZB/BINJ and C57BL/6N origin on a C57BL/6N nuclear background. This mouse line showed a pronounced age-dependent NZB mtDNA accumulation in the liver, thus leading to enhanced respiration capacity per mtDNA molecule. Remarkably, liver-specific atg7 (autophagy related 7) knockout abolished NZB mtDNA accumulat ion, resulting in close-to-neutral mtDNA segregation through development into adulthood. prkn (parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) knockout also partially prevented NZB mtDNA accumulation in the liver, but to a lesser extent. Hence, we propose that age-related liver mtDNA segregation is a consequence of macroautophagic clearance of the less-fit mtDNA. Considering that NZB/BINJ and C57BL/6N mtDNAs have a level of divergence comparable to that between human Eurasian and African mtDNAs, these findings have potential implications for humans, including the safe use of mitochondrial replacement therapy.Abbreviations: Apob: apolipoprotein B; Atg1: autophagy-related 1; Atg7: autophagy related 7; Atp5a1: ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, alpha subunit 1; BL6: C57BL/6N mouse strain; BNIP3: BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MAP1LC3A: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha; MAP1LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; Mt-Atp8: mitochondrially encoded ATP synthase 8; MT-CO1: mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase I; MT-CO2: mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase II; Mt-Co3: mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase III; Mt-Cytb: mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b; MtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; MUL1: mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase activator of NFKB 1; Ndufa9: NADH:ubiquinone oxireductase subunit A9; NDUFB8: NADH:ubiquinone oxireductase subunit B8; Nnt: nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase; NZB: NZB/BINJ mouse strain; OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation; PINK1: PTEN induced putative kinase 1; Polg2: polymerase (DNA directed), gamma 2, accessory subunit; Ppara: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; Ppia: peptidylprolyl isomerase A; Prkn: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; P100: post-natal day 100; Rpl19: ribosomal protein L19; Rps18: ribosomal protein S18; SDHB: succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit B, iron sulfur (Ip); SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; Ssbp1: single-stranded DNA binding protein 1; TFAM: transcription factor A, mitochondrial; Tfb1m: transcription factor B1, mitochondrial; Tfb2m: transcription factor B2, mitochondrial; TOMM20: translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20; UQCRC2: ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase core protein 2;] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [peptidylprolyl isomerase A protein] and [TOMM20 protein] interact with each other?

Background: Structural chromosome abnormality is an important cause of human diseases, including recurrent pregnancy loss . DNA double-strand breaks repair-related genes play critical roles in structural chromosome abnormality. The present study aims to investigate the potential contribution of double-strand breaks repair-related gene polymorphisms to structural chromosome abnormality. Methods: Fifty-four affected recurrent pregnancy loss individuals with structural chromosome abnormality, 88 affected recurrent pregnancy loss individuals without structural chromosome abnormality, and 84 controls were analyzed. Targeted whole-exome sequencing was used for screening single nucleotide polymorphisms in six double-strand breaks repair-related genes (EP300, XRCC6, LIG4, XRCC4, PRKDC, and DCLRE1C), and validation was performed by Sanger sequencing. Finally, we detected the frequency of radiation-induced chromosome translocations in no structural chromosome abnormality samples with significant polymorphisms by fluorescence in situ hybridization . Frequencies of EP300 rs20551, XRCC6 rs132788, and LIG4 rs1805388 were significantly different between structural chromosome abnormality recurrent pregnancy loss and no structural chromosome abnormality recurrent pregnancy loss (p = 0.030, 0.031, and 0.040 respectively).

BACKGROUND: Declining proteostasis with aging contributes to increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease . Emerging studies implicate impairment of the endosome-lysosome pathway as a significant factor in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Previously, we demonstrated that BAG3 regulates phosphorylated tau clearance. However, we did not fully define how BAG3 regulates endogenous tau proteostasis, especially in the early stages of disease progression. Live-cell imaging was used to study the dynamics of the endosomal pathway. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were performed in human alzheimer's disease brains and in P301S tau transgenic mice with BAG3 overexpressed. RESULTS: The primary group of neuronal BAG3 interactors identified are involved in the endocytic pathway. We demonstrated that a BAG3-HSP70-TBC1D10B complex attenuates the ability of TBC1D10B to inactivate RAB35. Thus, BAG3 interacts with TBC1D10B to support the activation of RAB35 and recruitment of HRS, initiating endosomal sorting complex required for transport-mediated endosomal tau clearance. Furthermore, TBC1D10B shows significantly less colocalization with BAG3 in alzheimer's disease brains than in age-matched controls. Overexpression of BAG3 in P301S tau transgenic mice increased the colocalization of phosphorylated tau with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport III protein CHMP2B and reduced the levels of the mutant human tau. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel BAG3-TBC1D10B-RAB35 regulatory axis that modulates endosomal sorting complex required for transport-dependent protein degradation machinery and tau clearance.

Mantle cell lymphoma is a mature B-cell neoplasm initially driven by CCND1 rearrangement with 2 molecular subtypes, conventional mantle cell lymphoma and leukemic non-nodal mantle cell lymphoma, that differ in their clinicobiological behavior. To identify the genetic and epigenetic alterations determining this diversity, we used whole-genome (n = 61) and exome (n = 21) sequencing (74% conventional mcl, 26% nnMCL) combined with transcriptome and DNA methylation profiles in the context of 5 mantle cell lymphoma reference epigenomes. We identified that open and active chromatin at the major translocation cluster locus might facilitate the t(11;14)(q13;32), which modifies the 3-dimensional structure of the involved regions. This translocation is mainly acquired in precursor B cells mediated by recombination-activating genes in both mantle cell lymphoma subtypes, whereas in 8% of cases the translocation occurs in mature B cells mediated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase. We identified novel recurrent mantle cell lymphoma drivers, including CDKN1B, SAMHD1, BCOR, SYNE1, HNRNPH1, SMARCB1, and DAZAP1. Complex structural alterations emerge as a relevant early oncogenic mechanism in mantle cell lymphoma, targeting key driver genes. Breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and translocations activated oncogenes (BMI1, MIR17HG, TERT, MYC, and MYCN), generating gene amplifications and remodeling regulatory regions. Cmantle cell lymphoma carried significant higher numbers of structural variants, copy number alterations, and driver changes than non-nodal mcl, with exclusive alterations of ATM in conventional mcl, whereas TP53 and TERT alterations were slightly enriched in non-nodal mcl. Several drivers had prognostic impact, but only TP53 and MYC aberrations added value independently of genomic complexity. An increasing genomic complexity, together with the presence of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and high DNA methylation changes related to the proliferative cell history, defines patients with different clinical evolution.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SMARCB1 protein] and [HNRNPH1 protein] interact with each other?

BACKGROUND: Astrocytoma is a common aggressive intracranial tumor and presents a formidable challenge in the clinic. Association of altered DNA methylation patterns of the promoter CpG islands with the expression profile of cancer-related genes, has been found in many human tumors. Therefore, DNA methylation status as such may serve as an epigenetic biomarker for both diagnosis and prognosis of human tumors, including astrocytoma. METHODS: We used the methylation specific PCR in conjunction with sequencing verification to establish the methylation profile of the promoter CpG island of thirty four genes in astrocytoma tissues from fifty three patients (The WHO grading: I: 14, II: 15, III: 12 and IV: 12 cases, respectively). In addition, compatible tissues (normal tissues distant from lesion) from three non-astrocytoma patients were included as the control. RESULTS: Seventeen genes (ABL, APC, APAF1, BRCA1, CSPG2, DAPK1, hMLH1, LKB1, PTEN, p14ARF, p15INK4b, p27KIP1, p57KIP2, RASSF1C, RB1, SURVIVIN, and VHL) displayed a uniformly unmethylated pattern in all the astrocytoma and non-astrocytoma tissues examined. However, the MAGEA1 gene that was inactivated and hypermethylated in non-astrocytoma tissues, was partially demethylated in 24.5% of the astrocytoma tissues (co-existence of the hypermethylated and demethylated alleles). Of the astrocytoma associated hypermethylated genes, the methylation pattern of the CDH13, cyclin a1, DBCCR1, EPO, MYOD1, and p16INK4a genes changed in no more than 5.66% (3/53) of astrocytoma tissues compared to non-astrocytoma controls, while the RASSF1A, p73, AR, MGMT, CDH1, OCT6, MT1A, WT1, and IRF7 genes were more frequently hypermethylated in 69.8%, 47.2%, 41.5%, 35.8%, 32%, 30.2%, 30.2%, 30.2% and 26.4% of astrocytoma tissues, respectively. Demethylation mediated inducible expression of the CDH13, MAGEA1, MGMT, p73 and RASSF1A genes was established in an astrocytoma cell line (U251), demonstrating that expression of these genes is likely regulated by DNA methylation. AR gene hypermethylation was found exclusively in female patients (22/27, 81%, 0/26, 0%, P < 0.001), while the IRF7 gene hypermethylation preferentially occurred in the male counterparts (11/26, 42.3% to 3/27, 11%, P < 0.05). Applying the mathematic method 'the Discovery of Association Rules', we have identified groups consisting of up to three genes that more likely display the altered methylation patterns in concert in astrocytoma. CONCLUSIONS: Of the thirty four genes examined, sixteen genes exhibited astrocytoma associated changes in the methylation profile. In addition to the possible pathological significance, the established concordant methylation profiles of the subsets consisting of two to three target genes may provide useful clues to the development of the useful prognostic as well as diagnostic assays for astrocytoma.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [p15INK4b protein] and [EPO protein] interact with each other?

Renal cell carcinoma subtypes are increasingly being discerned via their molecular underpinnings. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, VHL mutation and 3p loss are well known; However, other genes with emerging important roles include SETD2, BAP1, and PBRM1, among others. Papillary renal cell carcinoma type 2 is now known to include likely several different molecular entities, such as fumarate hydratase deficient renal cell carcinoma. Some TFE3 fusion partners, such as NONO, GRIPAP1, RBMX, and RBM10 may show a deceptive fluorescence in situ hybridization result due to the proximity of the genes on the same chromosome. Fumarate hydratase and succinate dehydrogenase deficient renal cell carcinoma have implications for patient counseling due to heritable syndromes and the aggressiveness of FH-deficient renal cell carcinoma. Emerging tumor types with strong evidence for distinct diagnostic entities include eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma and TFEB/VEGFA/6p21 amplified renal cell carcinoma.

Glucose transport in lymphocytes is regulated by many agents. It is interesting if only changing glucose concentrations in environment involves the impact on glucose uptake. The aims of this study were to investigate the impact of changing glucose concentrations in medium on deoxy-d-glucose uptake and what these conditions impact on the percent of cells with expression of chosen glucose transporters in human lymphocytes B and T. Isolated lymphocytes B and T obtained from healthy subject were cultivated in different concentrations of glucose. The experiments were carried out using tritium labeled deoxy-d-glucose and flow cytometry. In comparison to normoglycemia, hyperglycemia impairs the uptake of deoxy-d-glucose more than hypoglycemia. Lymphocytes B manifest significantly lower uptake of deoxy-d-glucose than lymphocytes T. Lymphocytes incubated in hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic medium show lower percent cells with expression of GLUT 1 and GLUT 3, and higher percent cells with expression of GLUT 4.

Western blot analysis showed that the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y expresses the proteins synaptotagmin l, synaptobrevin, synapsin-l, rab3a, syntaxin, SNAP-25, NSF, alpha-SNAP, and munc-18, which have been implicated in the movement, docking, and fusion of vesicles during exocytosis from other neuroendocrine cells. The subcellular localization of secretogranins I and II, synaptotagmin l, neuropeptide Y, rab3a, synaptobrevin, synaptophysin, and syntaxin was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy and revealed punctate staining patterns characteristic of secretory vesicles. The comigration of noradrenaline, secretogranin II, and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase on sucrose-D2O gradient fractions indicates the presence of a population of noradrenaline-containing large dense-cored vesicles . In addition, a lighter vesicle population is also present that does not appear to be noradrenergic and contains a 48-kDa synaptophysin antigen absent from the large dense-cored vesicles. Immunocytochemical experiments show that not all of the vesicles that express synaptotagmin l contain secretogranin II. Thus, our studies suggest that two types of vesicle are present in SH-SY5Y cells, one of which, the large dense-cored vesicles, contains noradrenaline. These findings confirm our previous studies suggesting that depolarization-evoked release of noradrenaline from SH-SY5Y occurs by LDCV exocytosis.

BACKGROUND: Familial involvement is common in dilated cardiomyopathy and >40 genes have been implicated in causing disease. However, the role of genetic testing in clinical practice is not well defined. We examined the experience of clinical genetic testing in a diverse dilated cardiomyopathy population to characterize the prevalence and predictors of gene mutations. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 264 unrelated adult and pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy index patients referred to 1 reference lab for clinical genetic testing. Up to 10 genes were analyzed (MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1, MYBPC3, ACTC, LMNA, PLN, TAZ, and LDB3), and 70% of patients were tested for all genes. The mean age was 26.6 +- 21.3 years, and 52% had a family history of dilated cardiomyopathy. Rigorous criteria were used to classify DNA variants as clinically relevant (mutations), variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS), or presumed benign. Mutations were found in 17.4% of patients, commonly involving MYH7, LMNA, or TNNT2 (78%). An additional 10.6% of patients had VUS. Genetic testing was rarely positive in older patients without a family history of dilated cardiomyopathy. Conversely in pediatric patients, family history did not increase the sensitivity of genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS: Using rigorous criteria for classifying DNA variants, mutations were identified in 17% of a diverse group of dilated cardiomyopathy index patients referred for clinical genetic testing.

Objective: To investigate the differential gene expression profiles of alpha-fetoprotein high- and low-expressing hepatocellular carcinoma, and to provide a theoretical basis for the molecular mechanism and prognosis analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: The transcriptome data and related clinical information from 368 hepatocellular carcinoma cases were obtained from the Cancer Gene Atlas public database. The samples were divided into alpha-fetoprotein high expression (AFP(high)) group and low expression (AFP(low)) group according to the quartile of alpha-fetoprotein mRNA expression, with 92 cases in each group. The functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the differential genes was performed using ClusterProfiler package. Results: The clinical analysis showed that high expression of alpha-fetoprotein was significantly associated with poor pathological differentiation and ethnicity (P<0.05 for both). GO enrichment analysis showed that the highly expressed genes were mainly correlated with the processes of appendage development, limb development, and skeletal system development, while lowly expressed genes were related to metabolic-related processes such as xenobiotic metabolism, steroid metabolism, and cellular response to xenobiotic stimuli. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that highly expressed genes were mainly involved in primary immunodeficiency, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, while lowly expressed genes were mainly involved in retinol metabolism, chemical carcinogenesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis and other pathways. A prognostic related gene set that was consisted of AURKB, TTK, CENPA, UBE2C, HJURP, and KIF15 was identified. And the high expression of this gene set was related to the shorter recurrence-free survival and overall survival time in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and its enrichment score was positively correlated with alpha-fetoprotein expression (r=0.475, P<0.001). The validation results of RNAseq data were basically consistent with the the cancer gene atlas data. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed that AURKB, KIF15, and UBE2C were significantly overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues with high alpha-fetoprotein expression. Although the expression of AURKB, TTK, KIF15, and UBE2C was not related to recurrence-free survival and overall survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients, there was a tendency that the patients with high alpha-fetoprotein levels showed relatively shorter recurrence-free survival time and overall survival time. Conclusions: There is a large difference in gene expression profiles between AFP(high) and AFP(low) hepatocellular carcinoma. The prognostic signature may cooperate with alpha-fetoprotein to promote the initiation and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. It also may explain the tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma with different alpha-fetoprotein levels, and provide new clues for the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [AURKB protein] and [KIF15 protein] interact with each other?

Like apoptosis, necroptosis is an innate immune mechanism that eliminates pathogen-infected cells. Receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP)3 (also called RIPK3) mediates necrotic death by phosphorylating an executioner protein, MLKL, leading to plasma membrane leakage. The pathway is triggered against viruses that block caspase 8. In murine CMV, the viral inhibitor of caspase 8 activation prevents extrinsic apoptosis but also has the potential to unleash necroptosis. This virus encodes the viral inhibitor of RIP activation to prevent RIP homotypic interaction motif -dependent signal transduction and necroptosis. Recent investigations reveal a similar mechanism at play in the human alpha-herpesviruses, herpes simplex virus 1 and HSV2, where rip homotypic interaction motif competitor function and caspase 8 suppression are carried out by the virus-encoded large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase . In human cells, reductase inhibition of caspase 8 prevents TNF-induced apoptosis, but sensitizes to TNF-induced necroptosis. The rip homotypic interaction motif and caspase 8 interaction domains of reductase collaborate to prevent RIP3-dependent steps and enable both herpesviruses to deflect host cell death machinery that would cut short infection. In mouse cells, HSV1 infection by itself triggers necroptosis by driving RIP3 protein kinase activity. HSV1 reductase contributes to the activation of RIP3 adaptor function in mice, a popular host animal for experimental infection. Based on these studies, infection of RIP3-kinase inactive mice should be explored in models of pathogenesis and latency. The necrotic death pathway that is suppressed during infection in the natural host becomes a cross-species barrier to infection in a non-natural host.

The combination of gene therapy and tissue engineering is one of the most promising strategies for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa . Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic disease characterised by mutations in the COL7A1 gene, encoding type VII collagen, which forms anchoring fibrils at the dermal-epidermal junction of the skin. This disease causes severe blistering and only palliative treatments are offered. In this study, the base of a strategy combining gene therapy and a tissue-engineered skin substitute (TES), which would be suitable for the permanent closure of skin wounds, was set-up. As a high transduction efficiency into fibroblasts and/or keratinocytes seems to be a prerequisite for a robust and sustained correction of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, different envelope pseudotyped retroviral vectors and the transduction enhancer EF-C were tested. At least a 3.1-fold and a 1.3-fold increased transduction were obtained in fibroblasts and keratinocytes, respectively, with EF-C as compared with polybrene. A continuous and intense deposit of haemagglutinin -collagen was observed at the dermal-epidermal junction of self-assembled TESs made of cells transduced with a HA-tagged COL7A1 vector. Furthermore, HA-tagged basal epidermal cells expressing keratin 19 were observed in TESs, suggesting stem cell transduction. This approach could be a valuable therapeutic option to further develop, in order to improve the long-term life quality of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa patients.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [EF-C protein] and [COL7A1 protein] interact with each other?

Omental adipose tissue proteomes of goat-kids from mothers fed with diet enriched with stearic acid (ST-kids), fish oil and standard diets (CTRL) were determined by quantitative iTRAQ 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis. Stearic acid induces changes in a higher number of proteins when compared to fish oil. Eleven proteins, namely AARS, ECl1, PMSC2, CP, HSPA8, GPD1, RPL7, OGDH, RPL24, FGA and RPL5 were decreased in ST-kids only. Four proteins, namely DLST, EEF1G, BCAP31 and RALA were decreased in fish oil only, and one, NUCKS1, was increased. Four proteins, namely PMSC1, PPIB, TUB5*2 and EIF5A1, were be less abundant in both ST- and FO- kids. Most of the protein whose abundance was decreased in ST kids (10 out of 15) are involved in protein metabolism and catabolism pathways. Qualitative gene expression analysis confirmed that all the proteins identified by mass spectrometry, with the exception of FGA, were produced by adipose tissue. Quantitative gene expression analysis demonstrated that two proteins, namely CP, a minor acute phase protein, and ECl1, involved in fatty acid beta oxidation, were downregulated at mRNA level as well.

An additional five adenomas were also analyzed by Northern hybridization. Immunohistochemical staining for CgA and for SgIV (with monoclonal antibody HISL-19) was also performed. Most prolactin and adrenocorticotropin adenomas did not express CgA messenger rna or protein, whereas growth hormone tumors had low to moderate amounts of CgA messenger rna by Northern and in situ hybridization analyses and were focally positive for CgA protein. CgB, SgII, SgIII, and SgV messenger rna transcripts were present in most adenomas, and SgIV protein was detected in all groups of tumors.

233036 2A2812479 2A2544793	TRIAD3	FSCN1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 17258725 Homozygous PMS2 deletion causes a severe colorectal cancer and multiple adenoma phenotype without extraintestinal cancer. BACKGROUND & AIMS: We report a patient of Indian descent with parental consanguinity, who developed 10 carcinomas and 35 adenomatous polyps at age 23 and duodenal adenocarcinoma at age 25. He also had dysmorphic features, mental retardation, and cafe-au-lait spots but no brain tumor. METHODS: Germ-line screening for APC and MYH/MUTYH mutations was normal as was immunohistochemistry for MLH1 and MSH2 proteins. Investigation by array-comparative genomic hybridization revealed deletion of a small region on chromosome 7. Using polymerase chain reaction, this region was refined to a 400-kilobase deletion, which included exons 9-15 of the PMS2 gene, and all coding regions of oncomodulin, TRIAD3, and FSCN1. Immunohistochemistry showed absent PMS2 expression in all tumors and normal tissue. Most tumors showed microsatellite instability, more marked at dinucleotide than mononucleotide repeats. The tumors harbored no somatic mutations in APC, BRAF, AXIN2, or beta-catenin, but KRAS2 and TGFBR2 mutations were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient represents a novel phenotype for homozygous PMS2 mutation and perhaps the most severe colorectal cancer phenotype-in terms of numbers of malignancies at an early age-described to date. PMS2 mutations-and perhaps other homozygous mismatch repair mutations-should be considered in any patient presenting with multiple gastrointestinal tumors, since our patient could not be distinguished clinically from cases with attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis or MUTYH-associated polyposis.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [TRIAD3 protein] and [FSCN1 protein] interact with each other?

The activation of gene transcription in eukaryotic organisms is regulated by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins as well as by non-DNA-binding proteins. In this report we describe the modulatory functions of a non-DNA-binding protein, SIN3 (also known as SDI1, UME4, RPD1, and GAM2) on the transactivation properties of the human progesterone receptor, GAL4, and the HAP1 activator in yeast. SIN3 positively regulates the transcriptional activities of GAL4 and the HAP1 activator. However, it has no effect on the transcriptional activities of the human glucocorticoid receptor and GCN4. Deletion analysis of the SIN3 paired amphipathic helix motifs shows that the PAH3 motif is essential for SIN3-mediated regulation of human progesterone receptor, GAL4, and the HAP1 activator.

Breast cancer is a major health burden that affects over one million women each year. It is the most prevalent cancer in women and the number one cancer killer of them worldwide. Of all breast cancer subtypes, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed. The objective of this study is to investigate the contribution of miR-126 in the tumorigenesis of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. MiR-126 was downregulated in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer tissues from young breast cancer patients, as shown through miRNA microarray analysis and RT-qPCR. Subsequently, the effect of the modulation of miR-126 levels on the proliferation, cell cycle progression, and spheres formation of the estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, was assessed by MTT assay, PI analysis, and mammosphere formation assay, respectively. MiR-126 overexpression significantly decreased MCF-7 proliferation and mammosphere-forming ability, but did not affect cell cycle progression. Then, in silico analysis determined SLC7A5, PLXNB2, CRK, PLK2, SPRED1, and IRS1 as potential targets of miR-126. RT-qPCR data showed that miR-126 overexpression significantly downregulated SLC7A5 and PLXNB2 mRNA levels in MCF-7. Finally, in silico survival analysis showed that high expression of miR-126 or low expression of SLC7A5 correlated with better overall survival of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients.

A critical and understudied property of endothelial cells is their ability to form lumens and tube networks. Although considerable information has been obtained concerning these issues, including the role of Cdc42 and Rac1 and their effectors such as Pak2, Pak4, Par6b, and co-regulators such as integrins, MT1-MMP and Par3; In this work, we identify new small GTPase regulators of EC tubulogenesis including k-Ras, Rac2 and Rap1b that act in conjunction with Cdc42 as well as the key downstream effectors, IQGAP1, MRCKbeta, beta-Pix, GIT1, and Rasip1 (which can assemble into multiprotein complexes with key regulators including alpha2beta1 integrin and MT1-MMP). In addition, we identify the negative regulators, Arhgap31 (by inactivating Cdc42 and Rac) and Rasa1 (by inactivating k-Ras) and the positive regulator, Arhgap29 (by inactivating RhoA) which play a major functional role during the EC tubulogenic process. Human EC siRNA suppression or mouse knockout of Rasip1 leads to identical phenotypes where ECs form extensive cord networks, but cannot generate lumens or tubes. Essential roles for these molecules during EC tubulogenesis include; I) establishment of asymmetric EC cytoskeletal polarization (subapical distribution of acetylated tubulin and basal membrane distribution of F-actin); And ii) directed membrane trafficking of pinocytic vacuoles or other intracellular vesicles along acetylated tubulin tracks to the developing apical membrane surface. Cdc42 co-localizes subapically with acetylated tubulin, while Rac1 and k-Ras strongly label vacuole/ vesicle membranes which accumulate and fuse together in a polarized, perinuclear manner. We observe polarized apical membrane and subapical accumulation of key GTPases and effectors regulating EC lumen formation including Cdc42, Rac1, Rac2, k-Ras, Rap1b, activated c-Raf and Rasip1 to control EC tube network assembly.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disease, caused by deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, resulting in accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans dermatan and heparan sulfate in organs and tissues. If untreated, patients with the severe phenotype die within the first decade of life. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent the development of fatal disease manifestations, prominently cardiac and respiratory disease, as well as cognitive impairment. Similarities and differences in the three animal models for MPS I are highlighted. Earliest symptoms, which present during the first 6 months of life, include hernias, coarse facial features, recurrent rhinitis and/or upper airway obstructions in the absence of infection, and thoracolumbar kyphosis. During the next 6 months, loss of hearing, corneal clouding, and further musculoskeletal dysplasias develop. Finally, late manifestations including lower airway obstructions and cognitive decline emerge. Cardiac symptoms are common in MPS I and can develop in infancy. The underlying pathogenesis is in the intra- and extracellular accumulation of partially degraded glycosaminoglycans and infiltration of cells with enlarged lysosomes causing tissue expansion and bone deformities. These interfere with the proper arrangement of collagen fibrils, disrupt nerve fibers, and cause devastating secondary pathophysiological cascades including inflammation, oxidative stress, and other disruptions to intracellular and extracellular homeostasis.

143331 2A2535594 2A2547361	Fbw7	Cdh1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 23670162 Regulation of APC(Cdh1) E3 ligase activity by the Fbw7/cyclin E signaling axis contributes to the tumor suppressor function of Fbw7. Fbw7 and Cdh1 are substrate-recognition subunits of the SCF- and APC-type E3 ubiquitin ligases, respectively. There is emerging evidence suggesting that both Fbw7 and Cdh1 function as tumor suppressors by targeting oncoproteins for destruction. Loss of Fbw7, but not Cdh1, is frequently observed in various human tumors. However, it remains largely unknown how Fbw7 mechanistically functions as a tumor suppressor and whether there is a signaling crosstalk between Fbw7 and Cdh1. Here, we report that Fbw7-deficient cells not only display elevated expression levels of SCF(Fbw7) substrates, including cyclin E, but also have increased expression of various APC(Cdh1) substrates. We further defined cyclin E as the critical signaling link by which Fbw7 governs APC(Cdh1) activity, as depletion of cyclin E in Fbw7-deficient cells results in decreased expression of APC(Cdh1) substrates to levels comparable to those in wild-type cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of cyclin E recapitulates the aberrant APC(Cdh1) substrate expression observed in Fbw7-deficient cells. More importantly, 4A-Cdh1 that is resistant to Cdk2/cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation, but not WT-Cdh1, reversed the elevated expression of various APC(Cdh1) substrates in Fbw7-deficient cells. Overexpression of 4A-Cdh1 also resulted in retarded cell growth and decreased anchorage-independent colony formation. Altogether, we have identified a novel regulatory mechanism by which Fbw7 governs Cdh1 activity in a cyclin E-dependent manner. As a result, loss of Fbw7 can lead to aberrant increase in the expression of both SCF(Fbw7) and APC(Cdh1) substrates. Our study provides a better understanding of the tumor suppressor function of Fbw7, and suggests that Cdk2/cyclin E inhibitors could serve as effective therapeutic agents for treating Fbw7-deficient tumors.

Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an autosomal-recessive disease that affects young children. It presents as a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome with activated macrophages and T lymphocytes. Mutations in the perforin 1 gene were found in FHL-2 in 15-50% of all cases. Defective granule exocytosis caused by mutations in the hMunc13-4 gene (UNC13D) has been described in FHL-3. FHL-4 patients have mutations in STX11, a t-SNARE involved in intracellular trafficking. We analyzed a large group of 63 unrelated patients with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis of different geographic origins (Turkey:32; Germany:23; others:8) for mutations in STX11, perforin 1 gene, and UNC13D. We identified mutations in 38 samples (20 in perforin 1 gene, 12 in UNC13D, and six in STX11). Of 32 patients from Turkey, 14 had mutations in perforin 1 gene, six had mutations in UNC13D, and six had mutations in STX11.

Mycotoxins are commonly encountered natural products, and are capable of poisoning animals or humans that inhale mold particles from mycotoxin-contaminated foods. Ochratoxin A is produced by Aspergillu ochracus and Penicillium verrucosum, and is often found in cereals and agricultural products. Although previous studies have focused on the potent nephrotoxicity and renal carcinogenicity of ochratoxin a, more recent studies suggest that it accumulates in the brain and causes oxidative stress and DNA damage in various brain regions and neuronal populations. In the present study, we undertook to investigate the potential harm caused by environmental exposure to ochratoxin a in terms of its effects on neuronal cell viability and proteome profiles. Ochratoxin a was found to significantly reduce the viabilities of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and mouse hippocampal HT22 cells, as assessed by lactic dehydrogenase release into culture media. Generation of reactive oxygen species was detected in OTA-treated SH-SY5Y and HT22 cells, however, caspase activation and increase in p53 phosphorylation were only detected in HT22 cells, and the expressions of several proteins were found to be significantly altered after treating HT22 cells with ochratoxin a. Valosin containing protein, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, Atp5b protein, nucleophosmin 1, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 delta isoform, ornithine aminotransferase, prohibitin, and peroxiredoxin 6, which have been suggested to be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, were up-regulated. Our findings suggest that coordinated regulations of molecular networks are involved in the OTA-induced cytotoxicity and that proteome response can be an indicative for neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Loss or mutations of the BRCA1 gene are associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers and with prostate cancer aggressiveness. Previously, we identified GADD153 as a target of BRCA1 protein, which increases doxorubicin sensitivity in human p53 -/- prostate cancer cells . Considering that p53 is a crucial target in cancer therapy, in this work we investigated p53 role in the regulation of transcription of GADD153. METHODS: We performed reverse transcription quantitative PCR, western blot and luciferase assays to analyze GADD153 and/or BRCA1 expression in response to ultraviolet or doxorubicin exposure in pca cells p53 stable-transfected cells and LNCaP (p53+/+) cells. BRCA1 protein recruitment to GADD153 promoter was studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR. To assess expression of BRCA1 and/or p53 target genes, we used a panel of stable-transfected prostate cancer cell lines. We finally analyzed these genes in vivo using BRCA1-depleted prostate cancer xenograft models. RESULTS: We found that GADD153 was highly induced by doxorubicin in pca cells ; However, this response was totally abolished in LNCaP (p53wt) and in p53-restituted pca cells . Furthermore, BRCA1 protein associates to GADD153 promoter after DNA damage in the presence of p53. Additionally, we demonstrated that BRCA1 and/or p53 modulate genes involved in DNA damage and cell cycle regulation (cyclin D1, BLM, BRCA2, DDB2, p21(WAF1/CIP1), H3F3B, GADD153, GADD45A, FEN1, CCNB2), EMT (E-cadherin, beta-catenin, vimentin, fibronectin, slug, snail) and Hedgehog pathways (SHH, IHH, DHH, Gli1, PATCH1). Furthermore, xenograft studies demonstrated that BRCA1 knockdown in pca cells increased tumor growth and modulated these genes in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Although BRCA1 induces GADD153 in a p53 independent manner, p53 abolished GADD153 induction in response to DNA damage. In addition, several important prostate cancer targets are modulated by BRCA1 and p53. Altogether, these data might be important to understand the therapy response of prostate cancer patients.

Many studies on atherosclerosis have indicated an association with Chlamydophila pneumoniae, a respiratory intracellular pathogen that can infect bronchoalveolar macrophages, and be transported to sites of vascular injury. Furthermore, the connection between low density lipoprotein, macrophages, foam cell formation, and atherosclerosis is well established. Five study models were designed to mimic the early events in plaque formation, i.e. untreated U937 human macrophages as control; Macrophages treated with low density lipoprotein only; Macrophages infected with the AR-39 strain of C. pneumoniae only; And the last two models in which macrophages were exposed to both C. pneumoniae and low density lipoprotein but in different order. Differential display RT-PCR was employed to analyze mRNAs from the five models to elucidate the transcriptional responses arising from macrophage interactions with C. pneumoniae and/or low density lipoprotein. In relation to atherosclerosis, some interesting modified transcripts are involved in cell proliferation (CDC2, CDC27, CDC42EP3, GBDR1, GPR6, RPL27A, Similar to COX2), apoptosis (BCL2A1), ubiquitination (CTSH, HSPC150, NUC2), and structural integrity (ACTG1, FLOT1).

Osteoporosis is the most common bone disorder worldwide and is associated with a reduced quality of life with important clinical and economic consequences. The most widely accepted etiopathogenic hypothesis on the origin of osteoporosis and its complications is that they are a consequence of the synergic action of environmental and genetic factors. Bone is constantly being remodelled through anabolic and catabolic pathways in which inflammation, the NF-kB pathway and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are crucial. The aim of our study was to determine whether polymorphisms in genes implicated in inflammation, the NF-kB pathway and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modified the risk of osteoporotic fracture. We analysed 221 patients with osteoporotic fracture and 354 controls without fracture from the HORTEGA sample after 12-14__^years of follow up. In addition, we studied the genotypic distribution of 230 single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in inflammation, NF-kB pathway and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Our results showed that be carrier of the C allele of the rs2228145 IL6R polymorphism was the principal genetic risk factor associated with osteoporotic fracture. The results also showed that variant genotypes of the rs4762 AGT, rs4073 IL8, rs2070699 END1 and rs4291 ACE polymorphisms were important genetic risk factors for fracture.

BACKGROUND: Nedd4 is a ubiquitin-protein ligase containing a calcium/lipid-binding domain, multiple WW domains and a C-terminal Hect domain, which is required for both the ubiquitin transfer and the association with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Nedd4 has been reported to be involved in the selective ubiquitination of some regulatory proteins in transcription and membrane transport. RESULTS: Three mRNA species for human Nedd4 were found to be 6.4-, 7.8- and 9.5-kb in size, and their expression patterns varied among normal tissues and cancer cell lines, indicating the tissue- and cell-specificities of Nedd4 expression. The Nedd4 protein, approximately 120 kDa in weight, was found in the cytoplasm, mainly in the perinuclear region and cytoplasmic periphery, of human cultured cells. Neural differentiation induced not only the down-regulation of Nedd4 but also the localization of the protein to both the cytoplasm and neurites. To identify the ubiquitination pathway that is linked to Nedd4, we demonstrated that specific E2 enzymes, including human Ubc4, UbcH5B, UbcH5C, UbcH6 and UbcH7, could transfer ubiquitin molecules to Nedd4 at the active cysteine residue, whereas E6AP accepted ubiquitins from Ubc4, UbcH5B, UbcH5C and UbcH7. Furthermore, nuclear localization of N-terminal deletion mutant Nedd4 enabled us to investigate the interaction between Nedd4 and E2 enzyme (Ubc4 or UbcH7) in the cell. The simultaneous expression of the full-length Nedd4 and E2 enzyme revealed the both proteins mostly colocalized in the cytoplasmic periphery, while the N-terminal deleted Nedd4 induced the nuclear and perinuclear colocalization with E2 enzyme.

LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE BINDING PROTEIN is an important mediator of the inflammatory reaction. A multitude of factors can determine the genic transcription activation and the increase of the lipopolysaccharide binding protein in the blood and the human body humours: Il1, Il 6, lipopolysaccharides, Gram-negative bacteria, as well as non-infectious agents. This paper is a prospective study performed on 147 patients admitted for acute appendicitis in 2010-2012 and evaluates the dynamics of lipopolysaccharide binding protein in acute appendicitis, by identifying the correlations between the pre- and post-operatory levels of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (up to 72 hours after surgery) and the anatomopathological type (i.e. catarrhal, phlegmonous and gangrenous). The mean pre-op lipopolysaccharide binding protein values are significantly different as to the histopathological result (p<0,005). Among the biological inflammatory markers measured in this present study, lipopolysaccharide binding protein has a dynamics of its own in the catarrhal and phlegmonous appendicitis. Thus, if after the surgical removal of the infectious source, the leukocites and neutrophiles decrease 72 hrs after surgery, lipopolysaccharide binding protein continues an ascending curve. The importance of this study consists in the introduction of last generation LBP-type inflammatory markers' dosage in the cecal appendix pathology.

Major depressive disorder is a prevalent, chronic, and relapse-prone psychiatric disease. To clarify the pathological changes in the dentate gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex regions of the major depressive disorder brain, which are the most closely related to the disease, we investigated the published microarray profile dataset GSE84183 to identify unpredictable chronic mild stress- (UCMS-) induced differentially expressed genes in the dentate gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex regions. The pathways and GO terms enriched by the differentially expressed genes in the dentate gyrus, such as cell adhesion, proteolysis, ion transport, transmembrane transport, chemical synaptic transmission, immune system processes, response to lipopolysaccharide, and nervous system development, may reveal the molecular mechanism of major depressive disorder. However, the differentially expressed genes in the anterior cingulate cortex involved metabolic processes, proteolysis, visual learning, DNA methylation, innate immune responses, cell migration, and circadian rhythm. Sixteen hub genes in the dentate gyrus (Fn1, Col1a1, Anxa1, Penk, Ptgs2, Cdh1, Timp1, Vim, Rpl30, Rps21, Dntt, Ptk2b, Jun, Avp, Slit1, and Sema5a) were identified.

Background: Chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and epigenetic events underlie lung cancer development. The study objective was that lung tumor expression levels of specific microRNAs and their downstream biomarkers may be differentially regulated in patients with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Methods: In lung specimens (tumor and non-tumor), microRNAs known to be involved in lung tumorigenesis (miR-21, miR-200b, miR-126, miR-451, miR-210, miR-let7c, miR-30a-30p, miR-155 and miR-let7a, qRT-PCR), DNA methylation, and downstream biomarkers were determined (qRT-PCR and immunoblotting) in 40 patients with lung cancer (prospective study, subdivided into LC-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, N___=___20/group). Results: Expression of miR-21, miR-200b, miR-210, and miR-let7c and DNA methylation were greater in lung tumor specimens of LC-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than of lung cancer patients. Expression of downstream markers PTEN, MARCKs, TPM-1, PDCD4, SPRY-2, ETS-1, ZEB-2, FGFRL-1, EFNA-3, and k-RAS together with P53 were selectively downregulated in tumor samples of LC-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. In these patients, tumor expression of miR-126 and miR-451 and that of the biomarkers PTEN, MARCKs, FGFRL-1, SNAIL-1, P63, and k-RAS were reduced. Conclusions: Biomarkers of mechanisms involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, migration, and apoptosis were differentially expressed in tumors of patients with underlying respiratory disease. These findings shed light into the underlying biology of the reported greater risk to develop lung cancer seen in patients with chronic respiratory conditions. The presence of an underlying respiratory disease should be identified in all patients with lung cancer as the differential biological profile may help determine tumor progression and the therapeutic response.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [P53 protein] and [ZEB-2 protein] interact with each other?

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 is caused by CAG repeat expansion in the TATA-box binding protein gene. Studies of several polyglutamine expansion diseases have suggested that the expanded polyglutamine proteins misfold and induce oxidative stress to contribute to cell death. Substantial deficits in peripheral tissues including lymphocytes have been shown and these peripheral abnormalities could also be found in neurons possessing polyglutamine disease proteins. In this study, we used a lymphoblastoid cell model to investigate the functional implication of spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 expanded alleles and assess the potential therapeutic strategies that may ameliorate the effects of expanded polyglutamine. A total of 8 proteins with reduced expression changes greater than 1.3-fold were identified, including previously reported HSPA5 and HSPA8. Among 6 proteins further semi-quantified by immunoblotting and real-time PCR, the reduced expression of HYOU1, PDIA3, P4HB, NQO1 and HMOX1 was confirmed. Treatment with resveratrol and genipin up-regulated NQO1 and HMOX1 expression and reduced oxidative stress in patients' lymphoblastoid cells. The results illustrate downregulation of proteins involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (HYOU1, HSPA5, PDIA3, and P4HB) and Nrf2-ARE signaling (NQO1 and HMOX1) in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 lymphoblastoid cells.

Endometrial cancer is the most common form of gynecological cancer. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Currently, no proteomic studies have investigated the role of diabetes in endometrial cancers from clinical samples. The present study aims to elucidate the molecular link between diabetes and endometrial cancer using a proteomic approach. Endometrial tissue samples were obtained from age-matched patients (endometrial cancer Diabetic and endometrial cancer Non-Diabetic) during surgery. The significantly upregulated proteins included peroxiredoxin-1, vinculin, endoplasmin, annexin A5, calreticulin, and serotransferrin. The significantly downregulated proteins were myosin regulatory light polypeptide 9, Retinol dehydrogenase 12, protein WWC3, intraflagellar transport protein 88 homolog, superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn], and retinal dehydrogenase 1. The network pathway was related to connective tissue disorder, developmental disorder, and hereditary disorder, with the identified proteins centered around dysregulation of ERK1/2 and F Actin signaling pathways.

To further explore the regulatory mechanism of brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene in osteoporosis, we further performed a set of data analyses, including linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis, epigenetic annotation, expression quantitative trait locus analysis and metabolic pathway analysis. Further, we have established a mouse pre-osteoblasts differentiation cell model (MC3T3-E1) by recombination human bone morphogenetic protein induction. SiRNA- mediated knock down of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in this cell model showed that all 14 SNPs are in the same haplotype block. Strong signals of active histone H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac modifications and P300 binding were observed in osteoblasts, in the region surrounding the most significant SNP rs16917237, suggesting that this SNP might have a regulatory function in osteoblasts. Furthermore, analysis of genotype data of rs16917237 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in multiple tissues from GTEx showed that rs16917237 SNP could significantly affect the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in 11 tissues. Through analysis of the various brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathways, we showed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor participates in the MAPK pathway, which is a vital and well-established pathway affecting osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation. SiRNA knock down of brain-derived neurotrophic factor significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of CREB, which is important in the MAPK pathway in osteoblast differentiation. These findings suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor might affect osteoblast differentiation via regulation of CREB expression.

Proteasomes are protease complexes essential for cellular homeostasis, and their activity is crucial for cancer cell growth. However, the mechanism of how proteasome activity is maintained in cancer cells has remained unclear. The CNC family transcription factor NFE2L1 induces the expression of almost all proteasome-related genes under proteasome inhibition. Both NFE2L1 and its phylogenetically closest homolog, NFE2L3, are highly expressed in several types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer. Here, we demonstrate that NFE2L1 and NFE2L3 complementarily maintain basal proteasome activity in cancer cells. Double knockdown of NFE2L1 and NFE2L3 impaired basal proteasome activity in cancer cells and cancer cell resistance to a proteasome inhibitor anticancer drug, bortezomib, by significantly reducing the basal expression of seven proteasome-related genes: PSMB3, PSMB7, PSMC2, PSMD3, PSMG2, PSMG3, and POMP Interestingly, the molecular basis behind these cellular consequences was that NFE2L3 repressed NFE2L1 translation by the induction of the gene encoding the translational regulator CPEB3, which binds to the NFE2L1 3' untranslated region and decreases polysome formation on NFE2L1 mRNA. Consistent results were obtained from clinical analysis, wherein patients with cancer having tumors expressing higher levels of CPEB3/NFE2L3 exhibit poor prognosis.

The gene kcnma1 encodes the alpha-subunit of high-conductance calcium- and voltage-dependent K+ (BK) potassium channel. With the development of generation gene sequencing technology, many KCNMA1 mutants have been identified and are more closely related to generalized epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia. Here, we performed a genetic screen of 26 patients with febrile seizures and identified a novel mutation of KCNMA1 (E155Q). Electrophysiological characterization of different KCNMA1 mutants in HEK 293T cells, the previously-reported R458T and E884K variants (not yet determined), as well as the newly-found E155Q variant, revealed that the current density amplitude of all the above variants was significantly smaller than that of the wild-type channel. Moreover, the beta4 subunit slowed down the activation of the E155Q mutant. Then, we used kcnma1 knockout (BK KO) mice as the overall animal model of loss-of-function mutants. It was found that BK KO mice had spontaneous epilepsy, motor impairment, autophagic dysfunction, abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, as well as possible anxiety and cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND: Mitogen-activated protein kinases are considered to play a prominent role in cardiac development, function, and pathogenesis. The different types of mitral valvular disease, including mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis, have different underlying pathophysiologic changes, but the precise intracellular signal transduction mechanisms are not clear. Thus, we investigated the differential regulation of MAPK signaling pathways in humans with different types of mitral valvular disease. METHODS: Left atrial appendage tissue samples from 32 patients with mitral valvular disease who were undergoing mitral valve replacement surgery were studied. Serum angiotensin II concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of MAPK pathway-related genes and proteins was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Echocardiography showed that patients with mitral stenosis had a greater left atrial pressure overload than those with mitral regurgitation. The relative amounts of angiotensin II, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1, p38alpha, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2, c-Fos, activating transcription factor 2, and c-Jun mRNA were significantly upregulated in those with mitral stenosis compared with those with mitral regurgitation (P < 0.05). The serum angiotensin II concentrations were significantly increased in those with mitral stenosis compared with those with mitral regurgitation (P = 0.017). Substantial changes in the phosphorylated forms of the MAPK proteins were detected. Phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and phosphorylated p38 were significantly increased in those with mitral stenosis compared with those with mitral regurgitation (P < 0.001), and phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the mitral regurgitation group was significantly greater than that in the mitral stenosis group (P < 0.001). Histologically, more serious myocardial cells losses, myolysis, and interstitial fibrosis were detected in the mitral stenosis group. CONCLUSIONS: The different types of mitral valvular disease have different hemodynamic characteristics, and different MAPK pathways were activated in the mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis groups, which could lead to diverse left atrial histologic changes.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [p38alpha protein] and [c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 protein] interact with each other?

BACKGROUND: Biomarkers predicting adverse outcomes in non-surgical intensive care patients have not been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data for 1,006 emergency department patients were prospectively analyzed. The serum heart-type fatty acid-binding protein level was measured within 10 min of admission. The patients were assigned to intensive care (n = 835) or other departments (n = 171). The intensive care patients were divided into survivors (n = 745) and non-survivors (n = 90) according to the in-hospital mortality and assigned to four groups according to the quartiles of s-heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4). The s-heart-type fatty acid-binding protein levels were significantly higher in the intensive care patients (12.7 [6.1-38.8] ng/ml versus 5.3 [3.1-9.4] ng/ml) and in the non-survivors (44.9 [23.2-87.6] ng/ml versus 11.5 [5.6-32.6] ng/ml). The sensitivity and specificity of heart-type fatty acid-binding protein for in-hospital mortality were 81.1 and 66.0 % (AUC 0.775) at 20.95 ng/ml.

Ipl1/Aurora B is the catalytic subunit of a protein kinase complex required for chromosome segregation and nuclear division. Before anaphase, Ipl1 is required to establish proper kinetochore-microtubule associations and to regulate the spindle assembly checkpoint . The phosphatase Glc7/PP1 opposes Ipl1 for these activities. To investigate Ipl1 and Glc7 regulation in more detail, we isolated and characterized mutations in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that raise the restrictive temperature of the ipl-2 mutant. These suppressors include three intragenic, second-site revertants in IPL1; 17 mutations in Glc7 phosphatase components (GLC7, SDS22, YPI1); Two mutations in SHP1, encoding a regulator of the AAA ATPase Cdc48; And a mutation in TCO89, encoding a subunit of the TOR Complex 1. Two revertants contain missense mutations in microtubule binding components of the kinetochore. rev76 contains the missense mutation duo1-S115F, which alters an essential component of the DAM1/DASH complex. The mutant is cold sensitive and arrests in G2/M due to activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. rev8 contains the missense mutation ndc80-K204E.

The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and the Transforming Growth Factor-beta are key regulators of hepatocarcinogenesis. Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor was proposed as a promising therapy; However, poor success was obtained in human hepatocellular carcinoma clinical trials. Here, we describe how epidermal growth factor receptor is frequently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma patients while transforming growth factor-beta is upregulated. Using 2D/3D cellular models, we show that after epidermal growth factor receptor loss, transforming growth factor-beta is more efficient in its pro-migratory and invasive effects, inducing epithelial to amoeboid transition. Epidermal growth factor receptor knock-down promotes loss of cell-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion, favouring TGF-beta-induced actomyosin contractility and acquisition of an amoeboid migratory phenotype. Moreover, transforming growth factor-beta upregulates RHOC and CDC42 after epidermal growth factor receptor silencing, promoting Myosin II in amoeboid cells. Importantly, low epidermal growth factor receptor combined with high TGFB1 or RHOC/CDC42 levels confer poor patient prognosis. In conclusion, this work reveals a new tumour suppressor function for epidermal growth factor receptor counteracting TGF-beta-mediated epithelial to amoeboid transitions in hepatocellular carcinoma, supporting a rational for targeting the transforming growth factor-beta pathway in patients with low epidermal growth factor receptor expression.

BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage has a high morbidity and mortality. Thus, we delineated the gene networks associated with human intracerebral hemorrhage in the peripheral blood transcriptome. We also compared the differentially expressed genes in blood following intracerebral hemorrhage to a prior human study of perihematomal brain tissue. METHODS: We performed peripheral blood whole-transcriptome analysis of intracerebral hemorrhage and matched vascular risk factor control subjects (n___=___66). Gene co-expression network analysis identified groups of co-expressed genes (modules) associated with intracerebral hemorrhage and their most interconnected genes (hubs). Mixed-effects regression identified differentially expressed genes in intracerebral hemorrhage compared to controls. RESULTS: Of seven ICH-associated modules, six were enriched with cell-specific genes: one neutrophil module, one neutrophil plus monocyte module, one T cell module, one Natural Killer cell module, and two erythroblast modules. And the Natural Killer cell module in genes regulating alternative splicing, epigenetic, and post-translational modifications. One erythroblast module was enriched in autophagy pathways implicated in experimental intracerebral hemorrhage, and NRF2 signaling implicated in hematoma clearance. Many hub genes or module members, such as IARS, mTOR, S1PR1, LCK, FYN, SKAP1, ITK, AMBRA1, NLRC4, IL6R, IL17RA, GAB2, MXD1, PIK3CD, NUMB, MAPK14, DDX24, EVL, TDP1, ATG3, WDFY3, GSK3B, STAT3, STX3, CSF3R, PIP4K2A, ANXA3, DGAT2, LRP10, FLOT2, ANK1, CR1, SLC4A1, and DYSF, have been implicated in neuroinflammation, cell death, transcriptional regulation, and some as experimental intracerebral hemorrhage therapeutic targets. Gene-level analysis revealed 1225 genes (FDR p___<___0.05, fold-change > |1.2|) have altered expression in intracerebral hemorrhage in peripheral blood. There was significant overlap of the 1225 genes with dysregulated genes in human perihematomal brain tissue (p___=___7________10-3). Overlapping genes were enriched for neutrophil-specific genes (p___=___6.4________10-08) involved in interleukin, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and PPAR signaling. CONCLUSIONS: This study delineates key processes underlying intracerebral hemorrhage pathophysiology, complements experimental intracerebral hemorrhage findings, and the hub genes significantly expand the list of novel intracerebral hemorrhage therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment is a high-risk factor for Alzheimer's disease . In the present study, we investigated the association of genetic polymorphisms of five genes (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), bridging integrator 1, sortilin-related receptor 1, presenilin 2 and nerve growth factor ) with mild cognitive impairment risk in a Xinjiang Uygur population. We also tested the relationship between the promoter methylation of genes OGG1 and dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase with mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: This study involved 43 mild cognitive impairment patients and 125 controls. DNA methylation assays used quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We found that polymorphisms of five genes and the methylation of dihydrolipoamide s-succinyltransferase and OGG1 genes were not associated with mild cognitive impairment (P___>___0.05). Further subgroup analysis found that dihydrolipoamide s-succinyltransferase hypomethylation was significantly associated with mild cognitive impairment in the carriers of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (P___=___0.042). In the carriers of non-apolipoprotein e epsilon4, dihydrolipoamide s-succinyltransferase methylation levels were significantly lower in the male control group than in the female control group (p___=___0.04). Meanwhile, among the non-apolipoprotein e epsilon4 carriers younger than 75, OGG1 hypermethylation levels were significantly associated with mild cognitive impairment (P___=___0.049). Dihydrolipoamide s-succinyltransferase methylation in female controls was significantly lower than that in male controls (P___=___0.003). According to gender stratification, there was a significant positive correlation of fasting plasma glucose (FBG) and high-density lipoprotein with OGG1 methylation in the female controls (FBG: P___=___0.024; high-density lipoprotein: P___=___0.033). There was a significant inverse correlation between low-density lipoprotein and dihydrolipoamide s-succinyltransferase methylation in male mild cognitive impairment (P___=___0.033). There was a significant positive correlation between high-density lipoprotein and dihydrolipoamide s-succinyltransferase methylation levels in the female controls (P___=___0.000).

Tumor cells often encounter hypoglycemic microenvironment due to rapid cell expansion. The tumor suppressor TIP60 functions as the catalytic subunit of the human NuA4 histone acetyltransferase multi-subunit complex and is involved in many different cellular processes including DNA damage response, cell growth and apoptosis. Attenuation of TIP60 expression has been detected in various tumor types. The function of TIP60 in tumor development has not been fully understood. Here we found that suppressing TIP60 inhibited p53 K120 acetylation and thus rescued apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation in hepatocellular cancer cells. Excitingly, Lys-104 (K104), a previously identified lysine acetylation site of TIP60 with unknown function, was observed to be indispensable for inducing p53-mediated apoptosis under low glucose condition. Mutation of Lys-104 to Arg (K104R) impeded the binding of TIP60 to human NuA4 complex, suppressed the acetyltransferase activity of TIP60, and inhibited the expression of pro-apoptotic genes including NOXA and PUMA upon glucose starvation. These findings demonstrate the critical regulation of TIP60/p53 pathway in apoptosis upon metabolic stress and provide a novel insight into the down-regulation of TIP60 in tumor cells.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [TIP60 protein] and [NOXA protein] interact with each other?

Introduction: Cocaine users often present with repetitive events of cocaine-associated chest pain, clinically resembling acute coronary syndromes. The aim of the study is to describe the specific risk factors for cocaine-associated chest pain. Method: Cocaine users (n = 316) were recruited for a multicenter cross-sectional study. Lifetime cocaine-associated chest pain history, sociodemographic factors, and lifetime use of cocaine and other substances were assessed. Thirty single nucleotide polymorphisms of NOS3, ROCK2, EDN1, GUCY1A3, and ALDH2 genes, suggested by the literature on coronary spasms, were selected. The associations with cocaine-associated chest pain history were tested using the chi-square test, Student's t-test and logistic regression. Results: Among the 316 subjects [78.5% men, mean age 37.5 years, (standard-deviation +-8.7)], 190 (60.1%) were daily cocaine users and 103 (32.6%) reported a lifetime cocaine-associated chest pain history. Among those with a lifetime cocaine-associated chest pain history, the median was 10 events per individual. In multivariate analysis, lifetime cocaine-associated chest pain history was associated with daily cocaine use [odds-ratio (OR) 3.24; 95% confidence intervals (1.29-9.33)], rapid route of cocaine use [OR 2.33 (1.20-4.64) vs. intranasal use], and lifetime amphetamine use [daily amphetamine use: OR 2.80 (1.25-6.32) and non-daily amphetamine use: OR 2.14 (1.15-4.04) vs. never used].

Our objective was to study the effects of Reptin silencing on the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in HCC cells. Treatment of HuH7 cells with etoposide (25 muM, 30 min) or gamma irradiation (4 Gy) increased the phosphorylation of H2AX by 1.94 _+- 0.13 and 2.0 _+- 0.02 fold, respectively. These values were significantly reduced by 35 and 65 % after Reptin silencing with inducible shRNA. Irradiation increased the number of BRCA1 (3-fold) and 53BP1 foci (7.5 fold). Depletion of Reptin reduced these values by 62 and 48%, respectively. These defects in activation and/or recruitment of repair proteins were not due to a decreased number of DSBs as measured by the COMET assay. All these results were confirmed in the Hep3B cell line. Protein expression of ATM and DNA-PKcs, the major H2AX kinases, was significantly reduced by 52 and 61 % after Reptin depletion whereas their mRNA level remained unchanged. Phosphorylation of Chk2, another ATM target, was not significantly altered. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we showed an interaction between Reptin and DNA-PKcs. The half-life of newly-synthesized DNA-PKcs was reduced when Reptin was silenced. Finally, depletion of Reptin was synergistic with etoposide or gamma irradiation to reduce cell growth and colony formation. In conclusion, Reptin is an important cofactor for the repair of DSBs. Our data, combined with those of the literature suggests that it operates at least in part by regulating the expression of DNA-PKcs by a stabilization mechanism. Overexpression of Reptin in HCC could be a factor of resistance to treatment, consistent with the observed overexpression of Reptin in subgroups of chemo-resistant breast and ovarian cancers.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [H2AX protein] and [Reptin protein] interact with each other?

Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data revealed that alternative splicing events could serve as prognostic biomarkers in various cancer types. This study examined lung adenocarcinoma tissues for alternative splicing and assessed alternative splicing events as potential indicators of prognosis in our cohort. We used SUPPA2 to analyze the alternative splicing profiles. Using univariate Cox regression analysis, overall survival -related alternative splicing events were identified. Genes relating to the OS-related alternative splicing events were imported into Cytoscape, and the CytoHubba application was run. OS-related splicing factors were explored using the log-rank test. The relationship between the percent spliced-in value of the OS-related alternative splicing events and SF expression was identified by Spearman correlation analysis. We found 1957 OS-related alternative splicing events in 1151 genes, and most were protective factors. Alternative first exon splicing was the most frequent type of splicing event. The hub genes in the gene network of the OS-related alternative splicing events were FBXW11, FBXL5, KCTD7, UBB and CDC27. The area under the curve of the MIX prediction model was 0.847 for 5-year survival based on seven OS-related alternative splicing events. Overexpression of splicing factors CELF2 and SRSF5 was associated with better overall survival. We constructed a correlation network between splicing factors and OS-related alternative splicing events.

Tobacco can induce reactive oxygen species production extensively in cells, which is a major risk factor for oral leukoplakia development. Peroxiredoxin 1 is a key antioxidant protein, upregulated in a variety of malignant tumors. We previously found that nicotine, the main ingredient of tobacco, promotes oral carcinogenesis via regulating peroxiredoxin 1. The aim of the present study was to screen and identify the peroxiredoxin 1 interacting proteins and investigate the mechanisms of nicotine on the development of oral leukoplakia. Through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with bioinformatics analysis, the candidate peroxiredoxin 1 interacting proteins of cofilin-1, tropomyosin alpha-3 chain (TPM3), and serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 65 kDa regulatory subunit A alpha isoform (PPP2R1A) were screened in human dysplastic oral keratinocyte cells treated with nicotine. Cofilin-1, TPM3, and PPP2R1A were highly expressed in human oral leukoplakia tissues. The expression of cofilin-1 increased and the expression of PPP2R1A decreased in oral leukoplakia of smokers compared to that in oral leukoplakia of non-smokers. Nicotine upregulated cofilin-1 and downregulated PPP2R1A in 4-nitro-quinoline-1-oxide -induced oral leukoplakia tissues in mice in part dependent on peroxiredoxin 1.

The stathmin family consists of phosphoproteins highly conserved in vertebrates and thought to be implicated in the development and functional regulation of various organs, most notably the nervous system. This family includes stathmin, SCG10, SCLIP, and RB3, phosphoproteins that are related by structural and functional homologies. They all sequester tubulin and interfere with microtubule dynamics, a property due to their shared stathmin-like domain. Little is known about the expression of the stathmin gene family in humans. Herein, we describe for the first time, for a collection of human tissues, the expression of each member of this family, using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. We found that stathmin is ubiquitously expressed, whereas SCG10 and RB3 are neural enriched, expression patterns similar to those reported for other mammals. Surprisingly, SCLIP, whose expression is thought to be neural-specific, exhibits a broader tissue distribution. Analyses of the SCLIP gene (approved symbol STMN3) show that it contains several NRSE-like elements that display low or no affinity for the cognate binding protein NRSF. The substantial expression of SCLIP in most tissues points out a novel function for this protein outside the nervous system and raises the possibility that its coexpression with stathmin could provide some degree of functional redundancy.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SCLIP protein] and [SCG10 protein] interact with each other?

OBJECTIVES: Several cytokines and innate immune-associated molecules are present in middle ear effusions, but damage-associated molecular patterns in middle ear effusion have not been studied. Therefore, we evaluated the role of heat shock proteins in the development of otitis media with effusion (OME). METHODS: Serous middle ear effusions from 22 pediatric patients who were diagnosed with OME and underwent ventilation tube insertion from June 2015 to March 2017 were evaluated in our study. The levels of Hsp 90, 70, 27, IL-8, and TNF-alpha in effusion fluids were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Hsp 70 and Hsp 27 were detected in all middle ear effusions, but Hsp 90 was detected in only five effusion fluid samples. IL-8 was also detected in all middle ear effusions, but TNF-alpha was detected in only four effusion fluid samples. When we compared the degree of tympanic membrane inflammation with the levels of Hsp 70, Hsp 27, and IL-8, which were detected in all effusion fluids, we could not find statistical significance. However, Hsp 70, Hsp 27, and IL-8 were significantly associated with each other (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hsp 70 and Hsp 27 were expressed in middle ear effusions.

However, the expression and distinct prognostic value of histone deacetylases in ovarian cancer have not been well elucidated.

We investigated the relationship between histone deacetylases mRNA level and the clinicopathological parameters of the ovarian cancer patients, such as histology subtypes, clinical stages, grades and TP53 mutation.

BACKGROUND: In eukaryotic protein synthesis, the multi-subunit elongation factor 1 plays an important role in ensuring the fidelity and regulating the rate of translation. EF-1alpha, which transports the aminoacyl tRNA to the ribosome, is a member of the G-protein superfamily. EF-1beta regulates the activity of EF-1alpha by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP and thereby regenerating the active form of EF-1alpha. The structure of the bacterial analog of EF-1alpha, EF-Tu has been solved in complex with its GDP exchange factor, EF-Ts. Although there is good sequence conservation between EF-1alpha and EF-Tu, there is essentially no sequence similarity between EF-1beta and EF-Ts. We wished to explore whether the prokaryotic exchange mechanism could shed any light on the mechanism of eukaryotic translation elongation. RESULTS: Here, we report the structure of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor domain of human EF-1beta (hEF-1beta, residues 135-224); Sequence conservation analysis of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor domains of elongation factor 1 subunits beta and delta from widely divergent organisms indicates that the most highly conserved residues are in two loop regions. Intriguingly, hEF-1beta[135-224] shares structural homology with the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor domain of EF-Ts despite their different primary sequences. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of both the structural homology between EF-Ts and hEF-1beta[135-224] and the sequence conservation analysis, we propose that the mechanism of guanine-nucleotide exchange in protein synthesis has been conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

We found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was assigned to the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely cause of the SCA phenotype.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SCA17 protein] and [SCA8 protein] interact with each other?

The intracellular anaplastic lymphoma kinase fragment shows striking homology with members of the insulin receptor family and was initially identified as an oncogenic fusion protein resulting from a translocation in lymphoma and more recently in a range of cancers. This tyrosine kinase receptor and its ligands, the growth factors pleiotrophin and midkine are highly expressed during development of the nervous system and other organs. Each of these genes has been implicated in malignant progression of different tumor types and shown to alter phenotypes as well as signal transduction in cultured normal and tumor cells. Beyond its role in cancer, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase receptor pathway is thought to contribute to nervous system development, function, and repair, as well as metabolic homeostasis and the maintenance of tissue regeneration. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase receptor activity in cancer can be up-regulated by amplification, overexpression, ligand binding, mutations in the intracellular domain of the receptor and by activity of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPRz. Here we discuss the evidence for ligand control of anaplastic lymphoma kinase activity as well as the potential prognostic and therapeutic implications from gene expression and functional studies.

Some cardiac pathologies in the elderly population vary between genders revealing that cardiac remodeling during aging may be sex-dependent. Herein, we analyzed the effects of cardiac aging in male and female C57Bl/6 mice in four age groups, 3, 6, 12, and 18 month old (n = 6-12 animals/sex/age), to elucidate which age-related characteristics of left ventricle remodeling are sex-specific. We focused particularly in parameters associated with age-dependent remodeling of the left ventricle extracellular matrix that are involved in collagen metabolism. Complementary to the traditional echocardiography, speckle tracking echocardiography revealed that circumferential strain rate declined in 18 month old females, compared to younger animals, but not in males, suggesting speckle tracking echocardiography as an earlier indicator for changes in cardiac function between sexes. Age-dependent collagen deposition and expression in the endocardium did not differ between sexes; However, other factors involved in collagen metabolism were sex-specific.

The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F complex (eIF4F) is a potential chemotherapeutic target in triple-negative breast cancer . This complex regulates cap-dependent translational initiation and consists of three core proteins: eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A1. More specifically, a (CGG)4 motif, which confers eIF4A dependency, was incorporated into the 5'-leader region of a luciferase-tdTomato lentiviral reporter construct. The Prestwick Chemical Library was then screened in multiple triple-negative breast cancer cell lines by measuring the tdTomato fluorescent intensity. We identified several cardiac glycosides as potential inhibitors of eIF4A1-mediated translation. Based on our studies, we find that cardiac glycosides inhibit the expression of eIF4A1. Our pursuits led us to the discovery that cardiac glycosides also decrease levels of c-MYC. Quantitative PCR confirmed that decreases in c-MYC and eIF4A were occurring at the transcriptional level. As such, disruption of the eIF4A1-c-MYC axis may be a viable approach in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. The novel combination of rocaglamide A and digoxin exhibited synergistic anti-cancer activity against triple-negative breast cancer cells in vitro.

Spinal muscular atrophy is characterized by degenerating lower motor neurons and an increased incidence of congenital bone fractures. Survival motor neuron levels are significantly reduced due to deletions/mutations in the telomeric SMN1 gene in these patients. We utilized the Smn(-/-) SMN2 mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy to determine the functional role for survival motor neuron in bone remodelling. MicroCT analysis of lumber vertebrae, tibia and femur bones from spinal muscular atrophy mice revealed an osteoporotic bone phenotype. Histological analysis demonstrated a thin porous cortex of cortical bone and thin trabeculae at the proximal end of the growth plate in the vertebrae of spinal muscular atrophy mice compared to wild-type mice. Histochemical staining of the vertebrae showed the presence of abundant activated osteoclasts on the sparse trabeculae and on the endosteal surface of the thin cortex in spinal muscular atrophy mice. Histomorphometric analysis of vertebrae from spinal muscular atrophy mice showed an increased number of osteoclasts. Serum TRAcP5b and urinary NTx levels were elevated, consistent with increased bone resorption in these mice. Spinal muscular atrophy mice showed a significant decrease in the levels of osteoblast differentiation markers, osteocalcin, osteopontin and osterix mRNA expression; However, there were no change in the levels of alkaline phosphatase expression compared to WT mice. Spinal muscular atrophy mouse bone marrow cultures revealed an increased rate of osteoclast formation (54%) and bone resorption capacity (46%) compared to WT mice. Pre-osteoclast cells from spinal muscular atrophy mice showed constitutive up-regulation of RANK receptor signalling molecules critical for osteoclast differentiation.

Although increased serum fibroblast growth factor 23 underlies the HYP phenotype, the mechanism(s) by which PHEX mutations inhibit fibroblast growth factor 23 degradation and/or enhance production remains unknown. Here we show that treatment of wild-type mice with the proprotein convertase inhibitor, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Dec), increases serum fibroblast growth factor 23 and produces the HYP phenotype. Because PC2 is uniquely colocalized with PHEX in osteoblasts/bone, we examined if PC2 regulates PHEX-dependent fibroblast growth factor 23 cleavage and production. Transfection of murine osteoblasts with PC2 and its chaperone protein 7B2 cleaved fibroblast growth factor 23, whereas Signe1 (7B2) RNA interference transfection, which limited 7B2 protein production, decreased fibroblast growth factor 23 degradation and increased Fgf-23 mRNA and protein. The mechanism by which decreased 7B2___PC2 activity influences Fgf-23 mRNA was linked to reduced conversion of the precursor to bone morphogenetic protein 1 (proBMP1) to active BMP1, which resulted in limited cleavage of dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1), and consequent increased Fgf-23 mRNA. The significance of decreased 7B2___PC2 activity in x-linked hypophosphatemia was confirmed by studies of hyp-mouse bone, which revealed significantly decreased Sgne1 (7B2) mRNA and 7B2 protein, and limited cleavage of proPC2 to active PC2. The expected downstream effects of these changes included decreased fibroblast growth factor 23 cleavage and increased fibroblast growth factor 23 synthesis, secondary to decreased BMP1-mediated degradation of DMP1. Subsequent Hexa-D-Arginine treatment of hyp-mice enhanced bone 7B2___PC2 activity, normalized fibroblast growth factor 23 degradation and production, and rescued the HYP phenotype. These data suggest that decreased PHEX-dependent 7B2___PC2 activity is central to the pathogenesis of x-linked hypophosphatemia.

Drebrin has been found in numerous cell culture lines and in many tissues of epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle and neural origin but not in, for example, cardiac, skeletal and certain types of smooth muscle cells, in hepatocytes and in the human epithelium-derived cell culture line A-431. By double-label fluorescence microscopy we have found drebrin enriched in actin microfilament bundles associated with plaques of cell-cell contact sites representing adhering junctions. These drebrin-positive, adhering junction-associated bundles, however, are not identical with the vinculin-containing, junction-attached bundles, and in the same cell both subtypes of microfilament-anchoring plaques are readily distinguished by immunolocalization comparing drebrin and vinculin. The intracellular distribution of the drebrin- and the vinculin-based microfilament systems has been studied in detail by confocal fluorescence laser scanning microscopy in monolayers of the polar epithelial cell lines, MCF-7 and PLC, and drebrin has been found to be totally and selectively absent in the notoriously vinculin-rich focal adhesions.

Brain injury occurs within days in simian immunodeficiency virus or human immunodeficiency virus infection, and some recovery may occur within weeks. Inflammation and oxidative stress associate with such injury, but what drives recovery is unknown. Chronic human immunodeficiency virus infection associates with reduced brain frontal cortex expression of the antioxidant/anti-inflammatory enzyme heme oxygenase-1 and increased neuroinflammation in individuals with cognitive impairment. We hypothesized that acute regional brain injury and recovery associate with differences in regional brain heme oxygenase-1 expression. Using SIV-infected rhesus macaques, we analyzed multiple brain regions through acute and chronic infection (90___days postinfection [dpi]) and quantified viral (simian immunodeficiency virus gag RNA), synaptic (PSD-95; synaptophysin), axonal (neurofilament/neurofilament light chain [NFL]), inflammatory, and antioxidant (enzymes, including heme oxygenase isoforms [HO-1, HO-2]) markers. PSD-95 was reduced in the brainstem, basal ganglia, neocortex, and cerebellum within 13___dpi, indicating acute synaptic injury throughout the brain. Unchanged NFL was consistent with no acute axonal injury. Simian immunodeficiency virus RNA expression was highest in the brainstem throughout infection, and it associated with neuroinflammation. Surprisingly, during the synaptic injury and recovery phases, HO-2, and not heme oxygenase-1, progressively decreased in the brainstem. Thus, acute simian immunodeficiency virus synaptic injury occurs throughout the brain, with spontaneous recovery in regions other than the brainstem. Within the brainstem, the high simian immunodeficiency virus load and inflammation, along with reduction of HO-2, may impair recovery. In other brain regions, stable HO-2 expression, with or without increasing heme oxygenase-1, may promote recovery. Our data support roles for heme oxygenase isoforms in modulating recovery from synaptic injury in simian immunodeficiency virus infection and suggest their therapeutic targeting for promoting neuronal recovery.IMPORTANCE Brain injury induced by acute simian (or human) immunodeficiency virus infection may persist or spontaneously resolve in different brain regions. The gradual recovery from such injury observed in many, but not all, brain regions in the rhesus macaque model is consistent with the possible existence of a therapeutic window of opportunity for intervening to promote recovery, even in those regions not showing spontaneous recovery.

Prenatal testosterone (T)-treated female sheep manifest peripheral insulin resistance and tissue-specific changes in insulin sensitivity with liver and muscle manifesting insulin resistance accompanied by inflammatory, oxidative and lipotoxic state. In contrast, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues are insulin sensitive in spite of visceral manifesting changes in inflammatory and oxidative state. We hypothesized that prenatal T-induced changes in tissue-specific insulin resistance arise from disrupted lipid storage and metabolism gene expression driven by changes in DNA and histone modifying enzymes. Changes in gene expression were assessed in liver, muscle and 4 adipose (VAT, subcutaneous, epicardiac and perirenal ) depots collected from control and prenatal T-treated female sheep. Prenatal T-treatment increased lipid droplet and metabolism genes PPARA and PLIN1 in liver, SREBF and PLIN1 in muscle and showed a trend for decrease in PLIN2 in perirenal. Among epigenetic modifying enzymes, prenatal T-treatment increased expression of 1) DNMT1 in liver and DNMT3A in visceral, perirenal, muscle and liver; 2) HDAC1 in epicardiac, HDAC2 in muscle with decrease in HDAC3 in visceral; 3) EP300 in visceral and epicardiac; And 4) KDM1A in visceral with increases in liver histone acetylation. Increased lipid storage and metabolism genes in liver and muscle are consistent with lipotoxicity in these tissues with increased histone acetylation likely contributing to increased liver PPARA.

Sult1a1, 1c2, 1d1, 2a1/2, and PAPSs2 hepatic expression gradually increased from birth until about 3 weeks of age and then declined somewhat thereafter, Sult1c1 expression was highest before birth and declined after that, and Sult3a1 mRNA expression was very low in fetal livers and remained low until 30 days of age, when expression in females dramatically increased, whereas it never increased in males. The organ-specific distribution of sulfotransferases as well as the different expression of the sulfotransferases in young animals may affect the pharmacokinetic behavior and organ-specific toxicity of xenobiotics.

We performed HTP-Y2H screens that included all standard controls, using the predicted intracellular proteins expressed from the human MHC class III region, a region of the genome associated with many autoimmune diseases. The 91 novel interactions identified provide insight into the potential functions of many MHC genes, including C6orf47, LSM2, NELF-E (RDBP), DOM3Z, STK19, PBX2, RNF5, UAP56 (BAT1), ATP6G2, LST1/f, BAT2, Scythe (BAT3), CSNK2B, BAT5, and CLIC1.

BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein lipase plays an important role in triglyceride metabolism. It is translocated across endothelial cells to reach the luminal surface of capillaries by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1), where it hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins. MicroRNA 377 is highly associated with lipid levels. However, how microrna 377 regulates triglyceride metabolism and whether it is involved in the development of atherosclerosis remain largely unexplored. Methods___and___Results: The clinical examination displayed that microrna 377 expression was markedly lower in plasma from patients with hypertriglyceridemia compared with non-hypertriglyceridemic subjects. Bioinformatics analyses and a luciferase reporter assay showed that DNA methyltransferase 1 was a target gene of microrna 377. Moreover, microrna 377 increased lipoprotein lipase binding to GPIHBP1 by directly targeting dna methyltransferase 1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and apolipoprotein E -knockout mice aorta endothelial cells . In vivo, hematoxylin-eosin, Oil Red O and Masson's trichrome staining showed that ApoE-knockout mice treated with microrna 377 developed less atherosclerotic plaques, accompanied by reduced plasma triglyceride levels. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that microrna 377 upregulates GPIHBP1 expression, increases the lipoprotein lipase binding to GPIHBP1, and reduces plasma triglyceride levels, likely through targeting dna methyltransferase 1, inhibiting atherosclerosis in ApoE-knockout mice.

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	NO, high confidence; Explanation: The context provided describes how microRNA-377 regulates triglyceride metabolism by targeting DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and subsequently increasing lipoprotein lipase (LPL) binding to GPIHBP1. However, there is no direct interaction mentioned between lipoprotein lipase protein and DNA Methyltransferase 1 protein. Instead, the interaction is mediated through the regulation of GPIHBP1 expression by microRNA-377, which indirectly affects the binding of LPL to GPIHBP1.

Treatment of glioblastoma remains a challenge using conventional chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, and is often ineffective as a result of drug resistance. We have assessed a novel nitrone-based agent, OKN-007, and found it to be effective in decreasing tumor volumes and increasing survival in orthotopic glioblastoma xenografts by decreasing cell proliferation and angiogenesis and increasing apoptosis. In this study, we assessed combining OKN-007 with temozolomide in vivo in a human G55 glioblastoma orthotopic xenograft model and in vitro in TMZ-resistant and TMZ-sensitive human glioblastoma cell lines. For the in vitro studies, cell growth, IC50 values, RNA-seq, RT-PCR, and ELISA were used to assess growth inhibition, possible mechanism-of actions associated with combined OKN-007__^+__^temozolomide versus temozolomide alone, and gene and protein expression levels, respectively. Microarray analysis of OKN-007-treated rat F98 glioma tumors was also carried out to determine possible mechanism-of actions of OKN-007 in glioma-bearing animals either treated or not treated with OKN-007. OKN-007 seems to elicit its effect on glioblastoma tumors via inhibition of tumorigenic TGF-beta1, which affects the extracellular matrix. When combined with temozolomide, OKN-007 significantly increases percent survival, decreases tumor volumes, and normalizes tumor blood vasculature in vivo compared to untreated tumors and seems to affect TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cells possibly via IDO-1, SUMO2, and PFN1 in vitro.

43644 2A2918856 2A2406504	TTN	ACTC1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 33237593 Actin-Associated Gene Expression is Associated with Early Regional Metastasis of Tongue Cancer. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze gene expression profile of tongue cancer associated with early lymph node metastasis using the cancer genome atlas data. METHODS: A total of 515 patients with matched RNAseq data of primary tumor and clinical data from the cancer genome atlas data were extracted. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the DAVID online tool. FFPE tissue of 285 patients were evaluated for the validation of relevant genes by imunofluorescence and immunohistochemical stain. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that most of the upregulated genes were associated with actin cytoskeleton and included following genes: ANKRD23, NO3, PDLIM3, MUSTN1, TNNT3, MYBPC1, MB, MYH3, TTN, ACTA1, and ACTC1. When comparing tongue cancer with cN0pN0 vs. pN0pN+ using the total tongue cancer cohort of the cancer genome atlas, ACTA1 was the only parameter which was associated with hidden lymph node metastasis in T1/2 (P = .019). Perineural invasion was significantly associated with high expression of ACTA1 (P___<___.001). Imunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that actin was overexpressed, while E-cadherin and N-cadherin were not significantly different.
