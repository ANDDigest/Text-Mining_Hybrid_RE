IEPA.d0 IEPA.d0.s0.e0 IEPA.d0.s0.e1	Oxytocin	IP3	[INST]Context: [PMID: 1645753 Vasopressin-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cultured rat inner medullary collecting duct cells is mediated by the oxytocin receptor. Studies were performed to identify the receptor that mediates AVP-stimulated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in cultured rat inner medullary collecting tubule (RIMCT) cells. While the selective V1 receptor agonist [Ho1, Phe2, Orn8] VT has no effect on inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production over the range of 10(-13)-10(-7) M, the selective V2 receptor agonist VDAVP stimulates IP3 production in dose-dependent fashion. Oxytocin stimulates IP3 production in dose-dependent fashion as well. AVP-stimulated phospholipase C activity is not inhibited by the V1 receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP(10(-7) M) but is eliminated by the V2 receptor antagonist d(CH2)5DTyr(Et)VAVP (10(-7) M). Similarly, the response to oxytocin is eliminated by the V2 receptor antagonist. The selective oxytocin receptor agonist [Thr4, Gly7] oxytocin does not stimulate cAMP production in RIMCT cells but does promote PI hydrolysis. The selective oxytocin receptor antagonist desGlyNH2d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)-Thr4]OVT (10(-7) M) does not inhibit AVP-stimulated cAMP production but eliminates IP3 production in response to AVP or the V2 receptor agonist VDAVP. These studies demonstrate that AVP or a V2 receptor agonist stimulate PI hydrolysis in cultured RIMCT cells via occupancy of the oxytocin receptor.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Oxytocin protein] and [IP3 protein] interact with each other?

Phosphoinositide hydrolysis, resulting in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DG) formation, has been implicated in oxytocin-stimulated pulsatile secretion of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) from uterine endometrium of sheep and other mammals. In reptiles, arginine vasotocin (AVT) stimulates uterine secretion of PGF2 alpha. These studies investigated the ability of AVT to stimulate incorporation of [3H]inositol into inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates in two reptilian species. In Experiment 1, AVT stimulated (P less than 0.01) IP formation in uterine from late-gravid (150 to 291%) and postpartum (104 to 363%) Yarrow's spiny lizards (Sceloporus jarrovi). Inositol phosphate formation, in response to AVT, was greater (P less than 0.01 for IP3 and P less than 0.05 for total IP) for gravid (stage 40 embryos) and postpartum (1-2 days) lizards near the time of parturition than for lizards at other stages (stage 38-39 embryos or 7 days postpartum). Inositol phosphate formation was greater (P less than 0.05) in uterine tissue from gravid than from postpartum lizards. In Experiment 2, basal IP formation and the response to AVT were the greatest (P less than 0.01) in endometrium from late-gravid American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). AVT stimulated (P less than 0.02) IP synthesis in uterine endometrium from vitellogenic (136 to 394%), early-gravid (7 to 270%), late-gravid (315 to 1002%), postpartum (86 to 313%), and nonreproductive (292 to 322%) alligators. Results indicate that (1) AVT stimulates IP formation in the uterus of reptiles; (2) uterine IP formation increases in late-gravid reptiles; and (3) increased responsiveness to AVT may occur at parturition or oviposition.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [inositol trisphosphate protein] and [oxytocin protein] interact with each other?

Cells were isolated from late pregnant rat myometrium and used as confluent monolayers after a single passage. All four agonists caused a biphasic release of 45Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial pool(s), with the rank order of potency: oxytocin > PGF2 alpha > ET-1 > IP3. Inhibitors of phospholipase C blocked ET-1- and oxytocin-promoted but not PGF2 alpha-promoted 45Ca2+ efflux. Similarly, heparin, an IP3 receptor blocker, failed to inhibit PGF2 alpha-induced 45Ca2+ release while inhibiting the action of the other agonists. Endothelin-1 and oxytocin stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation at concentrations similar to those that promoted 45Ca2+ efflux, whereas about 100 times higher concentrations of PGF2 alpha were needed to activate this signaling pathway in intact cells.

The Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes complex processing resulting in the production of a 4-kDa amyloid peptide (A beta) which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have shown that cells can secrete carboxyl terminus truncated APP derivatives (APP-S) in response to physiological stimulus. We have used human central nervous system neurons (NT2N) derived from a teratocarcinoma cell line (NT2) to study the signal transduction pathways involved in APP-S secretion and A beta production. Muscarinic receptors (m2 and m3) as well as the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Gq and the beta 1 isoform of phospholipase C were present in NT2N neurons. Stimulation of the muscarinic receptor with carbachol resulted in phospholipase C activation as shown by a transient increase in the second messengers 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Carbachol also caused an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels measured in single NT2N neurons. Under these conditions, carbachol caused a time-dependent 2-fold increase in APP-S secretion into the medium. In contrast, prolonged treatment with carbachol caused a decrease in A beta production into the medium. These results suggest that APP-S secretion and A beta production in NT2N neurons are regulated by the muscarinic/phospholipase C signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, activation of this pathway results in dissociation of APP-S secretion and A beta production.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [APP-S protein] and [phospholipase C protein] interact with each other?

Therefore, there is an interaction between the APP-S protein and the phospholipase C protein in the sense that the activity of phospholipase C is required for the secretion of APP-S.</s>

Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI 4-kinase) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate kinase (PIP kinase) were assayed in membranes prepared from samples of human frontal cortex initially frozen at autopsy. PI 4-kinase activity was significantly lower in Alzheimer's disease patients relative to age-matched controls or patients with Parkinson's disease. PIP kinase was not different in Alzheimer's versus age-matched controls. The beta amyloid protein fragment 1-40 inhibited PI 4-kinase activity in assays of control human or rat cortical membranes. Fragments 1-28 and 25-35 could not mimic the effects of fragment 1-40 while a reverse peptide 40-1 was equipotent. The inhibition of PI 4-kinase by fragment 1-40 was competitive with substrate. The beta amyloid protein fragments had diverse effects on phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) as assayed in rat cortical membranes. Low concentrations of fragment 1-40 stimulated, while high concentrations of 1-40 or 40-1 inhibited PI-PLC activity. Fragment 25-35 stimulated PI-PLC nearly 3-fold, while fragment 1-28 had only minor effects on the enzyme.

Pulsatile secretion of endometrial prostaglandin (PG)F2 alpha is stimulated by oxytocin (OT) during late diestrus in domestic ruminants (i.e., cattle, sheep and goats) and results in corpus luteum (CL) regression leading to the onset of a new estrous cycle. Pulsatile PGF2 alpha release is also responsible for CL regression in swine, but the stimulus for its secretion from the uterine endometrium is not known. We propose that OT binds to specific OT receptors (OTR) on the endometrium to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, thereby activating the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-diacylglycerol (DAG) second-messenger system to promote pulsatile PGF2 alpha secretion. Exogenous OT administered to cyclic gilts during late diestrus (days 10-16) decreased interestrous interval in three of four experiments. However, OT did not promote CL regression in hysterectomized gilts indicating that the effect of OT was uterine-dependent. Circulating concentrations of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF2 alpha (the major stable metabolite of PGF2 alpha) were increased (p < 0.01) 10 min after i.v. injection of OT on days 14 and 16 in cyclic gilts and on days 10-16 in pregnant gilts, but the magnitude of the response to OT on all days in pregnant gilts was markedly reduced compared to the response in cyclic gilts on days 14 and 16.

IEPA.d21 IEPA.d21.s45.e0 IEPA.d21.s45.e1	IP3	oxytocin	[INST]Context: [PMID: 8713999 Mechanisms regulating oxytocin receptor coupling to phospholipase C in rat and human myometrium. Oxytocin increases myometrial intracellular free calcium by promotion of calcium entry and release of calcium from intracellular stores. Calcium release from intracellular stores is secondary to an increase in phosphoinositide (PI) turnover and generation of IP3. We have explored the biochemical basis for the coupling of oxytocin (OT) to phospholipase C (PLC). Rat myometrial membranes contain PLC beta, gamma, and delta isoforms as well as the GTP-binding proteins G alpha(q) and G alpha(11). Oxytocin stimulates both GTPase and PLC activity in rat and human myometrial membranes. These data and available structural information suggest that the oxytocin receptor couples to PLC through a GTP-binding protein. In support of this hypothesis, an antibody generated against the specific C-terminal region of G alpha(q) and G alpha(11) inhibits both the oxytocin-stimulated GTPase and PLC activities. This inhibition is reversed by neutralization of the antibody with the antigenic peptide. The data indicate that the oxytocin receptor couples to PLC, presumably of the beta subclass, via interaction with proteins of the G alpha(q/11) subclass. In the nonpregnant, estrogen-primed rat, the stimulation of PI turnover by oxytocin is inhibited by the hormone relaxin and by pertussis toxin. The effects of both of these agents are mediated by the action of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In plasma membranes, GTP-stimulated PLC activity can also be inhibited by treatment with protein kinase A. These data suggest that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation at a step involving GTP-binding protein/PLC coupling can exert a negative effect on the stimulation of IP3 formation by oxytocin and thereby affect contraction/relaxation in the myometrium.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [IP3 protein] and [oxytocin protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence; Explanation: The context provided indicates that oxytocin stimulates phosphoinositide (PI) turnover, which leads to the generation of IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate). IP3 is a key second messenger that mediates the release of calcium from intracellular stores, thereby contributing to the contraction/relaxation of the myometrium. This suggests that oxytocin and IP3 are part of the same signaling pathway, where oxytocin triggers the production of IP3, indicating an interaction between the oxytocin protein and the IP3 protein.</s>

Part 1: Mechanisms for a chemically induced pathogenesis/transmissibility. It is proposed that exposure of the bovine embryo to specific high-dose lipophilic formulations of organophosphate insecticide (containing phthalimide) applied exclusively in the UK during the 1980s/early 1990s was the primary trigger that initiated the UK's bovine spongioform encephalopathy epidemic. Multi-site binding organophosphate toxic metabolites penetrate the fetus, covalently binding with, phosphorylating and ageing serine, tyrosine or histidine active sites on fetal central nervous system prion protein. An abnormal negative charge corrupts prion protein molecular surface, which blocks both proteases and chaperones from accessing their cleavage/bonding sites. This impairs normal degradation and folding of prion protein respectively. Once the abnormally phosphorylated abnormal prion protein isoform agent is initiated, any stress event ensuing in adult life induces a nerve growth factor-mediated synthesis of normal cellular prion protein isoform that aggregates to abnormally phosphorylated abnormal prion protein isoform, thereby becoming 'infected'/transformed into the same; due to the vicious circle of positive feedback invoked by the blocking of a prion protein-specific kinase. Prion protein could therefore serve as a hitherto unrecognized critical link in a chain of delayed neuroexcitotoxic proteins that are triggered off by chronic exposure to specific classes of chemical/metal that 'hit and run' during the vulnerable in utero period, producing spongioform encephalopathy disease years later.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [prion protein protein] and [kinase protein] interact with each other?

Part 2: An epidemiological perspective. This paper elucidates the flaws in the official hypothesis that bovine spongioform encephalopathy originated from alterations in the way that scrapie-contaminated cattlefeeds were manufactured in the UK. An alternative hypothesis is proposed that cites exposure of the bovine embryo to various specific high-dose lipophilic formulations of organophosphates, such as the high-dose phthalimide containing organophosphate phosmet, (which were applied compulsorily and exclusively in the UK during the 1980s/early 1990s) as the primary trigger that initiated the deformation of prion protein and the onset of the bovine spongioform encephalopathy epidemic. The multi-site binding metabolites of these organophosphates penetrate the fetus, covalently phosphorylating various active sites on fetal prion protein. The extra charged phosphate groups left on aged prion protein blocks both proteases and chaperones from accessing their catalytic/bonding sites, creating the undergradable, misfolded isoform of prion protein, PrPsc. The resulting abnormally phosphorylated PrPsc aggregates to freshly synthesized PrPc, transforming it into same; due to a system of positive feedback invoked by the organophosphate-induced blockage of a prion protein-specific protein kinase. Both the timing, distribution and dynamics of usage of these specific organophosphates correlates with the epidemiology of bovine spongioform encephalopathy as well as accounting for the 23,000 cattle that have developed the disease, yet were born after the 1988 ban on scrapie-contaminated cattlefeed.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [prion protein protein] and [protein kinase protein] interact with each other?

The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms. Male rats were given oxytocin in doses of 2 or 20 ng (SC) or 2 or 200 ng (ICV). Trunk blood was collected and hormone analysis performed by radioimmunoassay. Subcutaneous injections of oxytocin increased insulin, glucagon and glucose levels significantly. Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point. This effect was abolished by atropine. The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate.

While it mentions that buspirone enhances the OT response during hypoglycemia, it does not indicate any direct interaction between OT protein and insulin protein. Instead, it describes how different serotonergic agonists influence the hormonal responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Therefore, there is no direct interaction mentioned between OT protein and insulin protein.</s>

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, which previously has been shown to release oxytocin, also influences plasma levels of gastrointestinal and pancreatic hormones, and if so, whether such an effect is mediated by an oxytocinergic mechanism. For this purpose 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) was injected to male rats pretreated with the oxytocin receptor antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin (1 mg/kg s.c.), or vehicle. Thirty min after injection of 8-OH-DPAT, plasma levels of oxytocin were significantly increased. 8-OH-DPAT also increased insulin and decreased CCK and somatostatin levels, effects that were blocked by pretreatment with the oxytocin antagonist. Taken together, these data suggest that the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on plasma levels of insulin, somatostatin and CCK may be mediated by oxytocin.

In a human vascular smooth muscle cell line (HVSMC), binding experiments with [3H]-arginine8-vasopressin (AVP) have shown the existence of a homogeneous population of binding sites with affinity (Kd value) of 0.65 nM and a maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of 122 fmol mg-1 protein. 2. Nonlabelled compounds compete for [3H]-AVP binding in the HVSMC membrane with an order of potency of oxytocin > lyspressin > or = AVP > Thr4, Gly7-oxytocin > (beta-mercapto-beta-beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionyl-O-Me Tyr2, Arg8) vasopressin > desmopressin > OPC21268 > OPC31260. This order was markedly different from that observed in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (A10), a well-established V1A receptor system. 3. In HVSMC both oxytocin and AVP increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production and [Ca2+]i response, but the efficacy of the responses was greater for oxytocin than AVP. 4. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay detected only oxytocin receptor but not V1A or V2 receptors in HVSMC, whereas only V1A receptors were found in A10 cells. 5. In conclusion, in HVSMC only oxytocin receptors are expressed among the vasopressin receptor family, and they coupled to phosphatidyl inositol (PI) turnover/Ca2+ signalling.

OT may rapidly stimulate inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) formation, consistent with the concept of rapid activation of a second-messenger system.

OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition. METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits. Prostaglandins (PGs) levels were also measured in the myometrial and decidual tissues. RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs). On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs. Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition.

OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition. METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits. Prostaglandins (PGs) levels were also measured in the myometrial and decidual tissues. RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs). On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs. Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition. When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation. However, OT had no effect on the production of cAMP, cGMP, prostaglandin (PG) E2 and F2 alpha in the myometria, even if receptors existed, although PGE2 production in the decidual tissues was markedly stimulated. In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation.

This study describes the mechanisms involved in the IGF-1 and IGF-2-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i in cultured chondrocytes and the involvement of type 1 IGF receptors. It shows that IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin increased the cytosolic free calcium concentration [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner, with a plateau from 25 to 100 ng/ml for both IGF-1 and IGF-2 and from 1 to 2 micrograms/ml for insulin. The effect of IGF-1 was twice as great as the one of IGF-2, and the effect of insulin was 40% lower than IGF-1 effect. Two different mechanisms are involved in the intracellular [Ca2+]i increase. 1) IGF-1 and insulin but not IGF-2 involved a Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated calcium channels: pretreatment of the cells by EGTA and verapamil diminished the IGF-1 or insulin-induced [Ca2+]i but did not block the effect of IGF-2. 2) IGF-1, IGF-2, and insulin also induced a Ca2+ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum: phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors, neomycin, or U-73122 partially blocked the intracellular [Ca2+]i increase induced by IGF-1 and insulin and totally inhibited the effect of IGF-2. This Ca2+ mobilization was pertussis toxin (PTX) dependent, suggesting an activation of a PLC coupled to a PTX-sensitive G-protein. Lastly, preincubation of the cells with IGF1 receptor antibodies diminished the IGF-1-induced Ca2+ spike and totally abolished the Ca2+ influx, but did not modify the effect of IGF-2. These results suggest that IGF-1 action on Ca2+ influx involves the IGF1 receptor, while part of IGF-1 and all of IGF-2 Ca2+ mobilization do not implicate this receptor.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [phospholipase C protein] and [insulin protein] interact with each other?

The onset of secretion in response to the addition of K+ was comparable in both species, but the magnitude of the response was significantly greater from rat islets. After the labeling of islet phosphoinositide pools with 2-[3H]inositol, the accumulation of labeled inositol phosphates (IP) in response to 30 mM K+ addition in the simultaneous presence of 20 mM glucose plus diazoxide was assessed. The addition of 30 mM K+ significantly increased IP accumulation approximately 300% in rat islets, whereas only an insignificant 25-30% increase was observed in mouse islets. The protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (50 nM) dramatically reduced the sustained secretory response from rat islets in the presence of 30 mM K+, 20 mM glucose, and diazoxide. Its effect was minimal on mouse islets and a significant inhibitory effect on insulin secretion was observed only during the final 5 min of the perifusion. The further addition of carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of phospholipase C distinct from that activated by glucose, together with K+, 20 mM glucose, plus diazoxide resulted in a sustained amplification of insulin secretion from mouse but not rat islets.

These results confirm previous observations with these species and document another anomaly that exists between the responses of rat islets compared with mouse islets.

The further addition of 30 mM K+ resulted in a rapid and sustained biphasic insulin secretory response. The onset of secretion in response to the addition of K+ was comparable in both species, but the magnitude of the response was significantly greater from rat islets. After the labeling of islet phosphoinositide pools with 2-[3H]inositol, the accumulation of labeled inositol phosphates (IP) in response to 30 mM K+ addition in the simultaneous presence of 20 mM glucose plus diazoxide was assessed. The addition of 30 mM K+ significantly increased IP accumulation approximately 300% in rat islets, whereas only an insignificant 25-30% increase was observed in mouse islets. The protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (50 nM) dramatically reduced the sustained secretory response from rat islets in the presence of 30 mM K+, 20 mM glucose, and diazoxide. Its effect was minimal on mouse islets and a significant inhibitory effect on insulin secretion was observed only during the final 5 min of the perifusion. The further addition of carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of phospholipase C distinct from that activated by glucose, together with K+, 20 mM glucose, plus diazoxide resulted in a sustained amplification of insulin secretion from mouse but not rat islets. K+ (30 mM)-induced insulin secretion in the presence of 3 mM glucose was similar from perifused rat or mouse islets, a finding that would seem to preclude the activation of voltage-regulated Ca2+ channels as the pertinent difference. These results confirm previous observations with these species and document another anomaly that exists between the responses of rat islets compared with mouse islets. The inability to activate a nutrient- and calcium-regulated phospholipase C isozyme in mouse islets to the same extent as in rat islets appears to account, at least in part, for these different insulin secretory responses under these unique conditions.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [phospholipase C protein] and [insulin protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence; Explanation: The context provided indicates that the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion. Specifically, the addition of 30 mM K+ in the presence of 20 mM glucose and diazoxide resulted in a significant increase in inositol phosphates (IP) accumulation, which is a product of PLC activity. This increase in IP accumulation was associated with an amplified insulin secretory response. The protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine also reduced the sustained secretory response, further supporting the role of PLC in insulin secretion. Therefore, the terms "phospholipase C protein" and "insulin protein" interact in the sense that the activation of PLC leads to changes in insulin secretion.</s>

We investigated the effects of arginine vasopressin (AVP) on nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity in cardiac myocytes by measuring the production of nitrite, a stable metabolite of NO, and the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein. Incubation of cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes for 24 hours with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) caused a significant increase in NO production. Both AVP and V1a receptor agonist [Phe2,Ile3,Orn8]vasopressin augmented NO synthesis in IL-1beta-stimulated, but not in unstimulated myocytes, in a dose-dependent manner. The V1a receptor antagonist [d(CH2)[5]1,O-Me-Tyr2,Arg8]vasopressin completely inhibited the effect of AVP. The AVP-induced NO production by IL-1beta-stimulated cells was accompanied by increased iNOS mRNA and protein accumulation. AVP caused a significant increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ levels of cardiac myocytes, whereas it showed no effect on cytosolic cAMP levels. After protein kinase C activity was functionally depleted by treating cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 hours, AVP did not augment IL-1beta-induced NO production. The effect of AVP was also inhibited in the presence of the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C. The addition of AVP increased protein kinase C activity in cardiac myocytes, and its effect was significantly inhibited in the presence of calphostin C. These results support the hypothesis that the heart may be a target organ for AVP and that AVP modulates IL-1beta-induced iNOS expression in myocytes through the V1a receptor, which is mediated at least partially via activation of protein kinase C.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [AVP protein] and [protein kinase C protein] interact with each other?

Overexpression of surrogate receptors [epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor] in adipocytes has demonstrated that multiple signaling pathways may lead to GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake. These implicated pathways function independently of IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI3-kinase activation.

This observation suggests that signaling molecules that are dependent on EGFR autophosphorylation, such as phospholipase C (PLC), may lie in the signaling pathway to glucose transport. As PLC has been implicated in glucose transport by several clinical and basic mechanistic studies, we investigated whether EGFR signaling may promote glucose transport via modulation of PLC activity. Activation of EGFR overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes leads to a 3.4 +/- 1.2-fold stimulation of PLC activity over basal levels vs. only 1.06 +/- 0.01-fold stimulation by insulin. Pharmacological inhibition of PLC by 50 microM U73122 reduced phosphoinositide accumulation by 79.2 +/- 16.9% and resulted in a concomitant 56.0 +/- 12.7% decrease in EGF-induced glucose transport. This inhibition of glucose transport by U73122 was specific, because the inactive congener, U73343, failed to block EGF-induced glucose transport. Despite the low levels of insulin-induced PLC activity, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was similarly inhibited by U73122 (55.9 +/- 13.1% inhibition).

We have recently shown that AVP causes a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in ACTH release and biosynthesis in ovine anterior pituitary cells. In these cells, AVP also causes the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the cell membrane which is maximal at 5 min, but the intracellular events distal to protein kinase C activation that underlie ACTH secretion have not been well characterized to date. Since the MARCKS protein has been implicated in neurosecretion and is phosphorylated by PKC in synaptosomes, studies were carried out to determine whether AVP might cause MARCKS phosphorylation in the ovine anterior pituitary, and to determine whether this phenomenon might be temporally correlated with PKC translocation and the release of ACTH. When cytosolic fractions of rat brain, ovine anterior pituitary, and cultured ovine anterior pituitary cells were incubated with purified PKC, several proteins were phosphorylated including those in the region of 83-85 kDa. After precipitation of the proteins with 40% acetic acid, the 83-85 kDa phosphoproteins were selectively recovered in the acid soluble phase. Phosphopeptide maps of either the 83 or 85 kDa proteins were generated with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and revealed 13 and 9 kDa phosphopeptides, which are characteristic of the authentic MARCKS protein. An identical phosphopeptide map was also obtained when the MARCKS protein was selectively extracted from intact 32P-labeled anterior pituitary cells. MARCKS phosphorylation was markedly increased when ovine anterior pituitary cells were exposed to 1 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). When the cells were exposed to 1 microM AVP, MARCKS phosphorylation increased at 15 s and reached the maximal plateau value at 30 s. MARCKS phosphorylation then started to diminish at 2 min, and baseline levels were attained by 10 min. In the same cells, AVP stimulated ACTH release in a biphasic manner - during the first 30 s, there resulted a rapid burst of ACTH secretion that was followed by a slower, but sustained rate of secretion. We conclude that: (1) AVP causes a rapid, and reversible, phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein in the ovine anterior pituitary; (2) since the AVP-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation occurs much earlier in these cells than does PKC trans-location, MARCKS phosphorylation may provide a more sensitive index of the onset of PKC activation than the translocation assay; (3) the close temporal association between MARCKS phosphorylation and the rapid early release of ACTH suggests that MARCKS phosphorylation may be involved in the initial intracellular events that underly exocytosis of the hormone.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [AVP protein] and [protein kinase C protein] interact with each other?

The aim of the present study was to investigate possible long-term effects of postnatally administered oxytocin on weight gain, gastrointestinal hormone levels, and nociceptive thresholds in rats. For this purpose, s.c. daily injections of oxytocin (1 mg/kg) or saline (NaCl, 0.9%) were given to male and female rat pups on d 10-14 after birth. The animals were killed at the age of 60 or 94 d. Treatment with oxytocin resulted in higher body weight in males, 60 d after birth, and in females from d 60 and throughout the rest of the experiment, compared with controls. The higher body weight was due to an increased weight gain in oxytocin-treated rats, compared with controls, which was most pronounced between 40 and 60 d after birth. Oxytocin-treated male rats had increased circulating levels of cholecystokinin, a tendency to increased plasma levels of insulin (p = 0.066), and relatively more adipose tissue in the thigh and interscapular region, compared with controls. At the age of 60 d, oxytocin-treated female and male rats had a prolonged withdrawal latency when measured in the tail-flick test, compared with controls.

Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) maps to a region on distal mouse chromosome 7 that has been linked to the phenotypes of obesity and type II diabetes. We recently reported that UCP2 expression is increased by high fat feeding in adipose tissue of the A/J strain of mice, which is resistant to the development of dietary obesity. More recently, a third UCP (UCP3) was identified, which is expressed largely in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue. The UCP2 and UCP3 genes are located adjacent to one another on mouse chromosome 7. Thus, the roles of these UCPs in both metabolic efficiency and the linkage to obesity and diabetes syndromes is unclear. For this reason, we examined the expression of UCP2 and UCP3 in white adipose tissue and interscapular brown adipose tissue and in gastrocnemius/soleus muscle preparations from the obesity-resistant A/J and C57BL/KsJ (KsJ) strains and the obesity-prone C57BL/6J (B6) mouse strain. In both KsJ and A/J mice, UCP2 expression in white fat was increased approximately 2-fold in response to 2 weeks of a high fat diet, but there was no effect of diet on UCP2 levels in B6 mice. In skeletal muscle and in brown fat, neither UCP2 nor UCP3 expression was affected by diet in A/J, B6, or KsJ mice. However, in brown fat, we observed a 2-3-fold increase in the expression of UCP1 in response to dietary fat challenge, which may be related to diet-induced elevations in plasma leptin levels. Together, these results indicate that the consumption of a high fat diet selectively regulates UCP2 expression in white fat and UCP1 expression in brown fat and that resistance to obesity is correlated with this early, selective induction of UCP1 and UCP2 and is not associated with changes in expression of UCP3.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [UCP1 protein] and [leptin protein] interact with each other?

Growth factors stimulate Na+/H+ exchange activity in many cell types but their effects on acid secretion via this mechanism in renal tubules are poorly understood. We examined the regulation of HCO3- absorption by nerve growth factor (NGF) in the rat medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL), which absorbs HCO3- via apical membrane Na+/H+ exchange. MTAL were perfused in vitro with 25 mM HCO3- solutions (pH 7.4; 290 mosmol/kgH2O). Addition of 0.7 nM NGF to the bath decreased HCO3- absorption from 13.1 +/- 1.1 to 9.6 +/- 0.8 pmol.min-1.mm-1 (P < 0.001). In contrast, with 10(-10) M arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the bath, addition of NGF to the bath increased HCO3- absorption from 8.0 +/- 1.6 to 12.5 +/- 1.3 pmol.min-1.mm-1 (P < 0.01). Both effects of NGF were blocked by genistein, consistent with the involvement of tyrosine kinase pathways. However, the AVP-dependent stimulation required activation of protein kinase C (PKC), whereas the inhibition was PKC independent, indicating that the NGF-induced signaling pathways leading to inhibition and stimulation of HCO3- absorption are distinct. Hypertonicity blocked the inhibition but not the AVP-dependent stimulation, suggesting that hypertonicity and NGF may inhibit HCO3- absorption via a common mechanism. These data demonstrate that NGF inhibits HCO3- absorption in the MTAL under basal conditions but stimulates HCO3- absorption in the presence of AVP, effects that are mediated through distinct signal transduction pathways. They also show that AVP is a critical determinant of the response of the MTAL to growth factor stimulation and suggest that NGF can either inhibit or stimulate apical Na+/H+ exchange activity depending on its interactions with other regulatory factors. Locally produced growth factors such as NGF may play a role in regulating renal tubule HCO3- absorption.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [AVP protein] and [protein kinase C protein] interact with each other?

Phospholipase C-gamma (PLCgamma) is the isozyme of PLC phosphorylated by multiple tyrosine kinases including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor receptors, and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. In this paper, we present evidence for the association of the insulin receptor (IR) with PLCgamma. Precipitation of the IR with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins derived from PLCgamma and coimmunoprecipitation of the IR and PLCgamma were observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To determine the functional significance of the interaction of PLCgamma and the IR, we used a specific inhibitor of PLC, U73122, or microinjection of SH2 domain glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins derived from PLCgamma to block insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. We demonstrate inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in isolated primary rat adipocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes pretreated with U73122. Antilipolytic effect of insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is unaffected by U73122. U73122 selectively inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase, leaving the Akt and p70 S6 kinase pathways unperturbed.

The present study was undertaken in order to establish the possible involvement of 5-HT3 serotonergic receptors in the control of basal and/or hypoglycemia-stimulated arginine vasopressin (AVP) and/or oxytocin (OT) secretion. For this purpose, 12 normal men were injected intravenously with a bolus of 4 mg ondansetron, a specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, under basal conditions (n = 6) or 30 min before insulin (0.15 IU/kg body weight) administration (n = 6) (insulin tolerance test (ITT)). Control experiments with normal saline instead of ondansetron treatment were performed. Furthermore, on a different occasion, the same subjects were tested in identical experimental conditions with 8 mg ondansetron. Our results showed that the hypoglycemic response to insulin was similar during the ITT and ondansetron plus ITT. Inhibition of 5-HT3 serotonergic receptors with ondansetron (4 or 8 mg) did not modify the basal secretion of AVP and OT and the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In contrast, the administration of 4 or 8 mg ondansetron significantly reduced in a similar manner hypoglycemia-induced AVP rise. Mean peak level at 45 min after insulin injection was 2.25 times higher than baseline in the control ITT and 1.5 times higher than basal value in the ondansetron (4 or 8 mg) plus ITT. These data demonstrate that 5-HT3 serotonergic receptors at least partially mediate the AVP response to hypoglycemia, without modifying the simultaneous OT response.

While it mentions that ondansetron affects AVP secretion, it does not indicate any direct interaction between OT protein and insulin protein. Instead, it describes the separate responses of AVP and OT to hypoglycemia and the influence of ondansetron on AVP secretion. Therefore, there is no evidence of a direct interaction between OT protein and insulin protein in the context provided.</s>
IEPA.d71 IEPA.d71.s172.e0 IEPA.d71.s172.e1	GA3	alpha-amylase	[INST]Context: [PMID: 9634587 Identification of a negative regulator of gibberellin action, HvSPY, in barley. To broaden our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of gibberellin (GA) action, we isolated a spindly clone (HvSPY) from barley cultivar Himalaya and tested whether the HvSPY protein would modulate GA action in barley aleurone. The HvSPY cDNA showed high sequence identity to Arabidopsis SPY along its entire length, and the barley protein functionally complemented the spy-3 mutation. HvSPY and SPY proteins showed sequence relatedness with animal O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferases (OGTs), suggesting that they may also have OGT activity. HvSPY has a locus distinct from that of Sln, a mutation that causes the constitutive GA responses of slender barley, which phenotypically resembles Arabidopsis spy mutants. The possibility that the HvSPY gene encodes a negative regulator of GA action was tested by expressing HvSPY in a barley aleurone transient assay system. HvSPY coexpression largely abolished GA3-induced activity of an alpha-amylase promoter. Surprisingly, HvSPY coexpression increased reporter gene activity from an abscisic acid (ABA)-inducible gene promoter (dehydrin), even in the absence of exogenous ABA. These results show that HvSPY modulates the transcriptional activities of two hormonally regulated promoters: negatively for a GA-induced promoter and positively for an ABA-induced promoter.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GA3 protein] and [alpha-amylase protein] interact with each other?

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence; Explanation: The context indicates that GA3 (gibberellin) induces the activity of an alpha-amylase promoter. The expression of HvSPY, which acts as a negative regulator of GA action, largely abolishes this GA3-induced activity. This suggests that GA3 and alpha-amylase are part of the same regulatory pathway, where GA3 influences the activity of the alpha-amylase promoter. Therefore, GA3 and alpha-amylase interact in the sense that GA3 regulates the expression of alpha-amylase.</s>

Intracerebroventricular leptin administration did not result in leakage of the hormone into the peripheral circulation. Thus, its effects were elicited by its presence within the central nervous system. Intracerebroventricular leptin infusion produced marked decreases in food intake and body weight gain relative to vehicle-infused fed ad libitum rats.

Intracerebroventricular leptin-infused and vehicle-infused pair-fed rats were characterized, relative to vehicle-infused ad libitum-fed animals, by decreases in body weight and insulinemia and by increases in insulin-stimulated overall glucose utilization and muscle and brown adipose tissue glucose utilization index.

In fact, the mean peak oxytocin response to hypoglycemia was 2.2 times higher than baseline in the absence of melatonin, whereas it was 1.6 times higher than basal value after administration of 6 or 12 mg melatonin. These data indicate an involvement of melatonin in the regulation of the oxytocin response to hypoglycemia in normal men. The lack of effects of melatonin on basal and angiotensin II-stimulated oxytocin secretion argues against the possibility that melatonin exerts an overall modulatory role on oxytocin secretion in humans.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [oxytocin protein] and [insulin protein] interact with each other?

Plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) is known to be elevated in patients with uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who have plasma hyperosmolality with hyperglycaemia. Although osmotic stimuli cause an increase in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity as well as synthesis of AVP and oxytocin in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON), it is not known whether NOS activity in the hypothalamus changes in the diabetic patients who have plasma hyperosmolality with hyperglycaemia caused by insulin deficiency. Expression of the neuronal (n) NOS gene in the PVN and SON in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats was investigated by using in situ hybridization histochemistry and NADPH-diaphorase histochemical staining. Four weeks after intraperitoneal (i. p.) administration of STZ, male Wistar rats developed hyperglycaemia and plasma hyperosmolality. The expression of nNOS gene and NADPH-diaphorase staining in the PVN and SON remarkably increased in STZ-induced diabetic rats compared to control rats. Three weeks after administration of STZ, the diabetic rats were subcutaneously treated with insulin for 1 week, which resulted in significant suppression of the induction of nNOS, AVP and oxytocin gene expression in the PVN and SON. Furthermore, the induction of nNOS gene expression in the PVN and SON was suppressed in STZ-induced diabetic rats treated with phlorizin and diet to normalize hyperglycaemia without insulin treatment. These results suggest that upregulation of nNOS gene expression as well as AVP and oxytocin gene expression in the PVN and SON in STZ-induced diabetic rats may be associated with hyperglycaemia and plamsa hyperosmolality.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [insulin protein] and [oxytocin protein] interact with each other?

OBJECTIVES: Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) secretions are abnormally stimulated by hypoglycaemia in patients with IDDM. Since previous studies showed that AVP secretion is influenced by the persistence of residual endogenous insulin secretion, we wondered whether this factor also regulates OT secretion. DESIGN: Case-control study: the OT response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was measured in normal and diabetic patients with or without residual endogenous insulin secretion. SUBJECTS: Ten normal male subjects, 10 C-peptide positive (CpP) and 11 C-peptide negative (CpN) male diabetic patients. PRELIMINARY STUDIES: plasma C-peptide levels were measured after intravenous administration of 1 mg glucagon. Insulin tolerance test (ITT): diabetics were studied after optimization of their metabolic status by 3 days of treatment with constant subcutaneous insulin infusion. CpP and CpN diabetics and normal controls were tested with an intravenous administration of 0.15 IU per kg body weight insulin. Blood samples for OT assay were taken just before the rapid injection of insulin (time 0) and at time 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. RESULTS: The basal concentrations of OT were similar in all groups. Insulin induced a similar hypoglycaemic nadir in all groups at 30 min, even though diabetic groups showed a delayed recovery in blood glucose levels. The glycaemic pattern was similar in all diabetic patients. Hypoglycaemia-induced OT rise was significantly higher in the two diabetic groups than in the normal group.

While it mentions that leptin increases UCP3 mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT), it does not indicate a direct interaction between the leptin protein and the UCP3 protein. Instead, it describes the modulation of gene expression by leptin, which is a separate process from a direct protein-protein interaction. Therefore, based on the given information, there is no evidence of a direct interaction between leptin protein and UCP3 protein.</s>

RESULTS: Oxy increased insulin release and [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner. Oxy-induced insulin release was not altered by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PT).

The inhibition of PLC by U-73122 reduces Oxy-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and IP3, and consequently, it also reduces Oxy-induced insulin release.

The intracellular regulation of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion from pituitary corticotroph cells was investigated by simultaneously exposing cultured ovine corticotrophs to arginine vasopressin (AVP) and raised extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]e). Both of these secretagogues activate L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (L-VSCC) as part of their respective ACTH secretory responses. When given together at high concentrations, AVP and raised [K+]e caused ACTH responses that were smaller in magnitude than the sum of the individual responses. However, at low agonist concentrations the simultaneous responses were greater in magnitude (i.e., synergistic).

BACKGROUND: Hormones such as parathyroid hormone (PTH), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are generally believed to act through cAMP to stimulate active Ca2+ reabsorption in the distal part of the nephron. METHODS: This study investigates the relationship between intracellular cAMP levels and the rate of Ca2+ reabsorption in immunodissected rabbit connecting and cortical collecting tubules cultured to confluence on permeable supports. RESULTS: Basolateral PTH, AVP, and PGE2 and apical adenosine dose dependently increased Ca2+ reabsorption from 48 to 110 nmol. hr-1. cm-2. Measurement of intracellular cAMP levels revealed that in the case of PTH and AVP, the dose-response curve for the increase in cAMP virtually matched that for transcellular Ca2+ transport. By contrast, with PGE2, this curve was shifted two decades to the right, whereas in the case of adenosine, no increase in cAMP was observed. The results with the latter two hormones disagree with the classic concept that Ca2+ reabsorption is stimulated via a cAMP-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, the potent adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2', 5'-dideoxyadenosine (DDA; 100 micrometers) suppressed the PTH- and AVP-induced increase in cAMP completely without affecting Ca2+ reabsorption. Similarly, concentrations of PGE2, which maximally stimulated Ca2+ reabsorption without increasing cAMP, were not inhibited by DDA.

Microglial interaction with amyloid fibrils in the brains of Alzheimer's and prion disease patients results in the inflammatory activation of these cells. We observed that primary microglial cultures and the THP-1 monocytic cell line are stimulated by fibrillar beta-amyloid and prion peptides to activate identical tyrosine kinase-dependent inflammatory signal transduction cascades. The tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk are activated by the fibrillar peptides and initiate a signaling cascade resulting in a transient release of intracellular calcium that results in the activation of classical PKC and the recently described calcium-sensitive tyrosine kinase PYK2. Activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 follows as a subsequent downstream signaling event. We demonstrate that PYK2 is positioned downstream of Lyn, Syk, and PKC. PKC is a necessary intermediate required for ERK activation. Importantly, the signaling response elicited by beta-amyloid and prion fibrils leads to the production of neurotoxic products. We have demonstrated in a tissue culture model that conditioned media from beta-amyloid- and prion-stimulated microglia or from THP-1 monocytes are neurotoxic to mouse cortical neurons. This toxicity can be ameliorated by treating THP-1 cells with specific enzyme inhibitors that target various components of the signal transduction pathway linked to the inflammatory responses.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [prion protein] and [tyrosine kinase protein] interact with each other?

During breastfeeding or suckling, maternal oxytocin levels are raised by somatosensory stimulation. Oxytocin may, however, also be released by nonnoxious stimuli such as touch, warm temperature etc. in plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid. Consequently, oxytocin may be involved in physiological and behavioral effects induced by social interaction in a more general context. In both male and female rats oxytocin exerts potent physiological antistress effects. If daily oxytocin injections are repeated over a 5-day period, blood pressure is decreased by 10-20 mmHg, the withdrawal latency to heat stimuli is prolonged, cortisol levels are decreased and insulin and cholecystokinin levels are increased. These effects last from 1 to several weeks after the last injection. After repeated oxytocin treatment weight gain may be promoted and the healing rate of wounds increased. Most behavioral and physiological effects induced by oxytocin can be blocked by oxytocin antagonists. In contrast, the antistress effects can not, suggesting that unidentified oxytocin receptors may exist. The prolonged latency in the tail-flick test can be temporarily reversed by administration of naloxone, suggesting that endogenous opioid activity has been increased by the oxytocin injections. In contrast, the long-term lowering of blood pressure and of cortisol levels as well as the sedative effects of oxytocin have been found to be related to an increased activity of central alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Positive social interactions have been related to health-promoting effects. Oxytocin released in response to social stimuli may be part of a neuroendocrine substrate which underlies the benefits of positive social experiences. Such processes may in addition explain the health-promoting effects of certain alternative therapies. Because of the special properties of oxytocin, including the fact that it can become conditioned to psychological state or imagery, oxytocin may also mediate the benefits attributed to therapies such as hypnosis or meditation.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [oxytocin protein] and [insulin protein] interact with each other?

The present study examined how arginine vasopressin (AVP) affects nitric oxide (NO) metabolism in cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells (GMC). GMC were incubated with test agents and nitrite, and intracellular cGMP content, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA, and iNOS protein were analyzed by the Griess method, enzyme immunoassay, and Northern and Western blotting, respectively. AVP inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-induced nitrite production in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with concomitant changes in cGMP content, iNOS mRNA, and iNOS protein. This inhibition by AVP was reversed by V1- but not by oxytocin-receptor antagonist. Inhibition by AVP was also reproduced on LPS and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors reversed AVP inhibition, whereas PKC activator inhibited nitrite production. Although dexamethasone and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC), inhibitors of nuclear factor-kappaB, inhibited nitrite production, further inhibition by AVP was not observed. AVP did not show further inhibition of nitrite production with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription, or cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. In conclusion, AVP inhibits LPS- and IL-1beta-induced NO production through a V1 receptor.

To understand the molecular mechanism of gibberellin-dependent gene regulation, the effect of three phosphatase inhibitors on the germination of rice seeds and the expression of a target gene, the alpha-amylase gene, Osamy-c, were measured. We found that okadaic acid, microcystin-LR, and calyculin A, which are known to specifically inhibit Ser/Thr phosphatases 1 and 2A, strongly inhibit the expression of the Osamy-c and may be involved in the germination of rice seeds. The protein phosphatase enzyme activity assays showed that there is no obvious effect of GA3 on total PP1/PP2A activities.

The discovery of uncoupling protein (UCP)-2, a ubiquitously expressed protein homologous to UCP-1, has raised the possibility that energy balance of cells might be regulated in tissues other than brown adipocytes. In normal pancreatic islets, UCP-2 is upregulated by leptin and is low in leptin-resistant islets of ZDF rats. To determine whether UCP-2 does, in fact, have uncoupling activity and, if so, whether such activity would favorably influence the abnormalities in leptin-unresponsive UCP-2-underexpressing islets of diabetic ZDF rats, we transferred the UCP-2 gene to the islets of diabetic ZDF rats and lean (+/+) ZDF control rats. Although ATP was reduced by 23% in both groups of islets, the ATP:ADP ratio increased by 42 and 141%, respectively. [3H]palmitate oxidation was increased by 50%, and [3H]glucose oxidation was 42-63% higher. Preproinsulin mRNA was 2.9-fold above control levels, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which was negligible in control ZDF rat islets, was improved in UCP-2-overexpressing islets. The high fat content of the islets was not reduced, however. We conclude that UCP-2 has uncoupling function when overexpressed in leptin-insensitive islets and that its overexpression corrects the underexpression of the insulin gene and ameliorates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, possibly by increasing the ATP:ADP ratio.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [UCP-2 protein] and [leptin protein] interact with each other?

This suggests that leptin and UCP-2 interact in a regulatory pathway where leptin influences the expression of UCP-2. The fact that UCP-2 is low in leptin-resistant islets of ZDF rats further supports this interaction, as it implies that the absence or resistance to leptin affects the expression of UCP-2. Therefore, the terms [UCP-2 protein] and [leptin protein] interact with each other.</s>

The Alzheimer's amyloid protein (Abeta) is released from the larger amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) by unidentified enzymes referred to as beta- and gamma-secretase. beta-Secretase cleaves APP on the amino side of Abeta producing a large secreted derivative (sAPPbeta) and an Abeta-bearing C-terminal derivative that is subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase to release Abeta. Alternative cleavage of the APP by alpha-secretase at Abeta16/17 releases the secreted derivative sAPPalpha. In yeast, alpha-secretase activity has been attributed to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored aspartyl proteases. To examine the role of GPI-anchored proteins, we specifically removed these proteins from the surface of mammalian cells using phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). PI-PLC treatment of fetal guinea pig brain cultures substantially reduced the amount of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the medium but had no effect on sAPPalpha.

The Alzheimer's amyloid protein (Abeta) is released from the larger amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) by unidentified enzymes referred to as beta- and gamma-secretase. beta-Secretase cleaves APP on the amino side of Abeta producing a large secreted derivative (sAPPbeta) and an Abeta-bearing C-terminal derivative that is subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase to release Abeta. Alternative cleavage of the APP by alpha-secretase at Abeta16/17 releases the secreted derivative sAPPalpha. In yeast, alpha-secretase activity has been attributed to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored aspartyl proteases. To examine the role of GPI-anchored proteins, we specifically removed these proteins from the surface of mammalian cells using phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). PI-PLC treatment of fetal guinea pig brain cultures substantially reduced the amount of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the medium but had no effect on sAPPalpha. A mutant CHO cell line (gpi85), which lacks GPI-anchored proteins, secreted lower levels of Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAPPbeta than its parental line (GPI+). When this parental line was treated with PI-PLC, Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAPPbeta decreased to levels similar to those observed in the mutant line, and the mutant line was resistant to these effects of PI-PLC.

The reperfusion of previously ischemic brain is associated with exacerbation of cellular injury. Reperfusion occasionally potentates release of intracellular enzymes, influx of Ca2+, breakdown of membrane phospholipids, accumulation of amyloid precursor protein or amyloid beta-(like) proteins, and apolipoprotein E. In this study, the effect of reperfusion injury on the activity of cerebral cortex enzymes acting on phosphatidyl [3H] inositol (PI) and [14C-arachidonoyl] PI was investigated. Moreover the effect of amyloid beta25-35 on PI degradation by phospholipase(s) of normoxic brain and subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury was determined. Brain ischemia in gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) was induced by ligation of both common carotid arteries for 5 min and then brains were perfused for 15 min, 2 h and 7 days. Statistically significant activation of enzyme(s) involved in phosphatidylinositol degradation in gerbils subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury was observed. Nearly all gerbils showed a higher activity of cytosolic PI phospholipase C (PLC) at 15 min after ischemia. Concomitantly, the significant enhancement of the level of DAG and AA radioactivity at this short reperfusion time confirmed the active PI degradation by phospholipase(s) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. After a prolonged reperfusion time of 7 days after ischemia, both cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of PI-PLC were activated. The question arises if alteration of membranes by the degradation of phospholipids occurring after an ischemic episode potentiates the effect of Abeta on membrane-bound enzymes. A neurotoxic fragment of amyloid, Abeta 25-35, incubated in the presence of endogenous Ca2+, increased significantly the PI-PLC activity of normoxic brain.

Moreover, A beta 25-35 had no effect on basal PIP2-PLC activity and cytosolic PI-PLC and PIP2-PLC. The aggregated form of A beta 25-35 significantly inhibited PIP2-PLC only in the presence of endogenous CaCl2. It also inhibited the carbachol and GTP(gamma)S-stimulated PIP2-PLC. Our findings show that depending on the aggregation state and Ca2+ concentration, A beta modulates phosphoinositide degradation differently and exclusively in brain synaptic plasma membranes. Our data suggested that aggregated A beta peptide may be responsible for the significant impairment of phosphoinositide signaling found in brain membranes during AD.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [A beta protein] and [PIP2-PLC protein] interact with each other?

The study shows that A beta 25-35 activates PI-PLC in synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) and inhibits PIP2-PLC in the presence of aggregated A beta 25-35. This suggests that A beta protein and PIP2-PLC interact with each other, as the presence of A beta peptide directly affects the activity of PIP2-PLC.</s>

Previously, we have described significant effects of human insulin on glucose metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under conditions of growth limitation. These regulations apparently rely on a transmembrane receptor capable of binding human insulin and responding by tyrosine/serine phosphorylation of a specific set of polypeptides [Muller, G., Rouveyre, N., Crecelius, A., and Bandlow, W.

(1998) Biochemistry 37, 8705-8713]. To characterize the molecular link between the initial steps in insulin-like signaling in yeast and the changes in the activities of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, we examined here the effects of human insulin on a set of key regulatory enzymes of glycogen metabolism, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDE), and protein kinase A (PKA). PP2A was activated about 2-fold by insulin in spheroplasts and in intact cells, whereas the fraction of active PKA was significantly reduced in a cAMP-independent manner as well as through a subsequent up to 3-fold increase in particulate cAMP-PDE activity accompanied by a 50% decrease in cytosolic cAMP levels. In addition, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), which in isolated rat adipocytes is activated by insulin, was stimulated to up to 5-fold by glucose and 10-fold by glucose plus insulin in both yeast spheroplasts and intact cells leading to a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the glucose-response curve for activation of the GPI-PLC. GPI-PLC was most pronouncedly stimulated by authentic human insulin compared to various insulin analogues and insulin-like growth factor I. In addition to lipolytic cleavage by GPI-PLC, the GPI anchor of the cAMP-binding ectoprotein, Gce1p, was secondarily processed by a rapid proteolytic event. As the GPI-PLC reaction is rate limiting, the efficiency of the two-step anchor cleavage was significantly increased when insulin was present together with glucose as compared to glucose alone. The insulin concentrations effective in modulating PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC activities correlate well with those required for half-saturation of the specific binding sites as well as for stimulation of protein phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation. The data suggest that mammalian insulin-sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC) involved in the transduction of the insulin signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C protein] and [insulin protein] interact with each other?

To characterize the molecular link between the initial steps in insulin-like signaling in yeast and the changes in the activities of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, we examined here the effects of human insulin on a set of key regulatory enzymes of glycogen metabolism, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDE), and protein kinase A (PKA). PP2A was activated about 2-fold by insulin in spheroplasts and in intact cells, whereas the fraction of active PKA was significantly reduced in a cAMP-independent manner as well as through a subsequent up to 3-fold increase in particulate cAMP-PDE activity accompanied by a 50% decrease in cytosolic cAMP levels. In addition, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), which in isolated rat adipocytes is activated by insulin, was stimulated to up to 5-fold by glucose and 10-fold by glucose plus insulin in both yeast spheroplasts and intact cells leading to a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the glucose-response curve for activation of the GPI-PLC. GPI-PLC was most pronouncedly stimulated by authentic human insulin compared to various insulin analogues and insulin-like growth factor I. In addition to lipolytic cleavage by GPI-PLC, the GPI anchor of the cAMP-binding ectoprotein, Gce1p, was secondarily processed by a rapid proteolytic event. As the GPI-PLC reaction is rate limiting, the efficiency of the two-step anchor cleavage was significantly increased when insulin was present together with glucose as compared to glucose alone. The insulin concentrations effective in modulating PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC activities correlate well with those required for half-saturation of the specific binding sites as well as for stimulation of protein phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation. The data suggest that mammalian insulin-sensitive cells and yeast share (part of) the key regulatory mechanism (consisting of PP2A, PKA, cAMP-PDE, and GPI-PLC) involved in the transduction of the insulin signal from the respective receptor systems to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C protein] and [insulin protein] interact with each other?

Arginine vasopressin (AVP), bombesin, and ACh increase cytosolic free Ca(2+) and potentiate glucose-induced insulin release by activating receptors linked to phospholipase C (PLC). We examined whether tolbutamide and diazoxide, which close or open ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (K(ATP) channels), respectively, interact with PLC-linked Ca(2+) signals in HIT-T15 and mouse beta-cells and with PLC-linked insulin secretion from HIT-T15 cells. In the presence of glucose, the PLC-linked Ca(2+) signals were enhanced by tolbutamide (3-300 microM) and inhibited by diazoxide (10-100 microM). The effects of tolbutamide and diazoxide on PLC-linked Ca(2+) signaling were mimicked by BAY K 8644 and nifedipine, an activator and inhibitor of L-type voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels, respectively. Neither tolbutamide nor diazoxide affected PLC-linked mobilization of internal Ca(2+) or store-operated Ca(2+) influx through non-L-type Ca(2+) channels. In the absence of glucose, PLC-linked Ca(2+) signals were diminished or abolished; this effect could be partly antagonized by tolbutamide. In the presence of glucose, tolbutamide potentiated and diazoxide inhibited AVP- or bombesin-induced insulin secretion from HIT-T15 cells. Nifedipine (10 microM) blocked both the potentiating and inhibitory actions of tolbutamide and diazoxide on AVP-induced insulin release, respectively. In glucose-free medium, AVP-induced insulin release was reduced but was again potentiated by tolbutamide, whereas diazoxide caused no further inhibition. Thus tolbutamide and diazoxide regulate both PLC-linked Ca(2+) signaling and insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by modulating K(ATP) channels, thereby determining voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) influx.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [phospholipase C protein] and [insulin protein] interact with each other?

The effects of tolbutamide and diazoxide on PLC-linked Ca(2+) signaling were mimicked by BAY K 8644 and nifedipine, an activator and inhibitor of L-type voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels, respectively. Neither tolbutamide nor diazoxide affected PLC-linked mobilization of internal Ca(2+) or store-operated Ca(2+) influx through non-L-type Ca(2+) channels. In the absence of glucose, PLC-linked Ca(2+) signals were diminished or abolished; this effect could be partly antagonized by tolbutamide. In the presence of glucose, tolbutamide potentiated and diazoxide inhibited AVP- or bombesin-induced insulin secretion from HIT-T15 cells. Nifedipine (10 microM) blocked both the potentiating and inhibitory actions of tolbutamide and diazoxide on AVP-induced insulin release, respectively. In glucose-free medium, AVP-induced insulin release was reduced but was again potentiated by tolbutamide, whereas diazoxide caused no further inhibition. Thus tolbutamide and diazoxide regulate both PLC-linked Ca(2+) signaling and insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by modulating K(ATP) channels, thereby determining voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) influx.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [PLC protein] and [insulin protein] interact with each other?

These Ca2+ spikes are dependent on L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and increase in frequency with increasing AVP concentration. The signal transduction pathway responsible for this effect was examined in fura-2-loaded A7r5 cell monolayers. The serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (5 nM) sensitized A7r5 cells to AVP, resulting in the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by 1-10 pM AVP. Calyculin A alone did not stimulate Ca2+ spiking. The protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 pM to 200 nM), also stimulated Ca2+ spiking and this effect was additive with a submaximal concentration of AVP (50 pM). The PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1 microM) and calphostin C (250 nM) completely blocked the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by either PMA or AVP. alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta and &lamdda; isoforms of PKC were detected in A7r5 cells by Western blot analysis.

Leptin is an adipocyte-secreted hormone that regulates body weight and exerts effects on hematopoiesis, reproduction, and immunity. The leptin receptor (OBR) shares sequence similarity and signaling capabilities with receptors for cytokines of the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) family. Our previous finding that CNTF and leptin exert similar anti-obesity effects and activate common neuronal signaling pathways, prompted us to investigate whether leptin may share with CNTF the ability to regulate the expression of specific neuronal genes. To this end, we established a cell line, derived from the murine septal cholinergic neuronal cell line SN-56, which stably expresses OBR. In this cell line, termed SN-56/OBR, leptin induces STAT transcription factor activation and STAT-dependent reporter gene expression in a manner similar to that of CNTF. Furthermore, in SN-56/OBR cells both CNTF and leptin produce changes in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide phenotype characteristic of cholinergic neurons, such as an increase in choline acetyltransferase and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and a decrease in neuropeptide Y expression. SN-56/OBR cells thus constitute an interesting new model system to investigate leptin action in cells of central nervous system origin. Possible physiological implications of OBR's intrinsic ability to regulate cholinergic phenotypic markers are discussed.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [leptin protein] and [neuropeptide Y protein] interact with each other?

Appetite control involves an integration of the drive signals arising form energy stores in the body with the satiety signals generated by periodic episodes of food consumption. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been implicated in the processes of within-meal satiation and postmeal satiety (5-HT1B and 5-HT2C postsynaptic receptors) which are concerned with the signals arising form the pattern of food intake. Central nervous system (CNS) 5-HT is sensitive to circulating levels of the precursor tryptophan, certain macronutrients and peripheral satiety factors such as cholecystokinin (CCK) and enterostatin. Hypothalamic 5-HT receptor systems inhibit neuropeptide Y (NPY), a potent stimulator of hunger and food intake. In contrast to the linking of 5-HT with the consequences of food ingestion, the hormone leptin (OB protein) is regarded as a signal linking adipose tissue status with a number of key CNS circuits. Leptin itself stimulates CNS leptin receptors (OB-r receptor) which link with pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)/ MC-4 receptors. The effects of leptin may also be modulated by factors such as the corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), orexins and galanin. Very little evidence exists to support any direct link between the actions of 5-HT and leptin, suggesting that they are separate systems. 5-HT is a part of an integrated network for short-acting satiety signals (episodic in nature), and leptin is a hormonal indicator of long-term (tonic) energy reserves. At a conceptual level, these may represent the distinction between 'satiety' and 'drive'.

The glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored protein, membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.19) is released from the surface of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to insulin treatment through the action of a phospholipase C. The present study investigates the role of guanine-nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins) in this process. Treatment of permeabilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes with GTPgammaS did not cause release of membrane dipeptidase into the medium, while GDPbetaS did not inhibit the insulin-stimulated release of membrane dipeptidase. Other activators of G-proteins, including the tetradecapeptide mastoparan, pertussis toxin and AlF3, also caused no significant release of membrane dipeptidase from the surface of the 3T3-L1 adipocytes. From these observations it is concluded that G-proteins are not involved in the insulin-stimulated release of membrane dipeptidase. Although X-Pro aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.9) is GPI-anchored in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as shown by digestion with bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, it was not released upon insulin treatment of the cells, indicating that only a subset of the GPI-anchored proteins are susceptible to insulin-stimulated release.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [insulin protein] and [phospholipase C protein] interact with each other?

Leptin is a satiety factor which acts within the hypothalamus to decrease the levels of several neuropeptides stimulating food intake (among them, neuropeptide Y [NPY]), while increasing those that inhibit food intake. These effects of leptin bring about decreased body weight. In vivo, leptin potentiates basal and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization, presumably its oxidation, and decreases fat storage. Leptin increases sympathetic-mediated energy dissipation, and the expression of uncoupling proteins-1, -2, and -3. In peripheral tissues (muscles, adipose, others), leptin decreases triglyceride content by increasing fatty acid oxidation, decreasing the activity/expression of esterification and lipogenic enzymes, and favoring lipolysis. It decreases the lipogenic activity of insulin. Ultimately, leptin depletes fat stores and promotes leanness. NPY, taken as one example of what an orexigenic agent may produce, increases food intake and body weight. It favors fat storage in adipose tissue by stimulating lipogenic activity. It decreases glucose utilization by muscles, making more glucose carbon available for lipogenesis. Effects of NPY result from vagus nerve-mediated hyperinsulinemia and overactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Thus, NPY favors fat stores, and ultimately obesity. Glucocorticoids are necessary for NPY effects to occur, because central administration of the neuropeptide in adrenalectomized animals is ineffective. Glucocorticoids also have genuine effects when administered centrally to normal rats. They increase the hypothalamic content of NPY and decrease that of CRH. This double neuro-peptidic change stimulates food intake, insulin output, adipose tissue storage ability, decreases the expression of uncoupling proteins-1 and -3, and increases body weight. Body weight homeostasis appears to require a finely tuned regulation of both leptin and glucocorticoids, with their respective opposite effects.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Leptin protein] and [neuropeptide Y protein] interact with each other?

We previously reported that adiposity and serum leptin levels increase with age in male F-344xBN rats and that when physiological levels of serum leptin are manipulated by fasting, there is a corresponding reciprocal change in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats. These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic NPY mRNA by leptin may be impaired with age. To test this hypothesis, we infused saline or leptin for 7 days into ad libitum-fed rats and compared these with saline-infused rats that were pair-fed the amount of food consumed by the leptin-treated rats. We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus. Food consumption decreased by 50% in the leptin-infused compared with the saline-infused young rats but only decreased by 20% in the aged rats. In the leptin-treated young rats, there was a 24% increase in oxygen consumption compared with the pair-fed rats, but there were no changes in oxygen consumption in the aged rats. Leptin infusion diminished hypothalamic NPY levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels in senescent rats. In summary, aged rats demonstrate a reduced responsiveness to leptin, including a diminished decrease in food intake and no increase in energy expenditure. These diminished responses to leptin were associated with and may be the result of an impaired suppression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels.

We previously reported that adiposity and serum leptin levels increase with age in male F-344xBN rats and that when physiological levels of serum leptin are manipulated by fasting, there is a corresponding reciprocal change in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in young rats, but there are no changes in older rats. These findings suggest that the regulation of hypothalamic NPY mRNA by leptin may be impaired with age. To test this hypothesis, we infused saline or leptin for 7 days into ad libitum-fed rats and compared these with saline-infused rats that were pair-fed the amount of food consumed by the leptin-treated rats. We examined daily food consumption, body weight, whole-body oxygen consumption, serum leptin, and NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus. Food consumption decreased by 50% in the leptin-infused compared with the saline-infused young rats but only decreased by 20% in the aged rats. In the leptin-treated young rats, there was a 24% increase in oxygen consumption compared with the pair-fed rats, but there were no changes in oxygen consumption in the aged rats. Leptin infusion diminished hypothalamic NPY levels by nearly 50% compared with pair-fed young rats, whereas there were no changes in the hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels in senescent rats. In summary, aged rats demonstrate a reduced responsiveness to leptin, including a diminished decrease in food intake and no increase in energy expenditure. These diminished responses to leptin were associated with and may be the result of an impaired suppression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels. This leptin resistance may be due to either the elevated obesity and serum leptin with age or due to age itself, or both.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Leptin protein] and [NPY protein] interact with each other?

We have shown previously that continuous (6 days) intracerebroventricular (ICV) leptin infusion in normal rats resulted in decreases in food intake and body weight. A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3. To investigate an involvement of thyroid hormones in this effect of leptin, plasma levels of these hormones were determined in ICV leptin-infused, ICV vehicle-infused ad libitum fed or pair-fed controls. ICV leptin infusion and pair-feeding resulted in decreased plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 levels relative to ad libitum fed controls. ICV leptin infusion maintained plasma levels of T3, but the levels were decreased by pair-feeding. The activity of the enzyme (hepatic 5'-monodeiodinase) responsible for T4/T3 conversion was measured. In the leptin-infused group, the activity of 5'-monodeiodinase was maintained at the values measured in ad libitum fed rats; in pair-fed rats, activity was reduced.

It was observed that in hypothyroid rats, ICV leptin was unable to maintain muscle UCP-3 expression at values measured in ad libitum fed controls. These results suggest that central leptin stimulates T3 production via an activation of T4 to T3 conversion, and that this stimulation could be responsible for the effect of leptin on muscle UCP-3 expression. Thyroid hormones could thus be important mediators of the effect of leptin on energy expenditure.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [leptin protein] and [UCP-3 protein] interact with each other?

Cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) undergoes a proteolytic attack at the 110/111 downward arrow112 peptide bond, whereas the PrP isoform (PrP(res)) that accumulates in the brain tissue in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease reveals an alternate cleavage site at about residue 90. Interestingly, the normal processing of PrP occurs inside the 106-126 amino acid region thought to be responsible for the neurotoxicity of the pathogenic prions, whereas PrP(res) cleavage preserves this potentially toxic domain. Therefore, any molecular mechanisms leading to enhanced cleavage at the 110/111 downward arrow112 peptide bond could be of potential interest. We set up TSM1 neurons and HEK293 stable transfectants overexpressing the wild-type or 3F4-tagged murine PrP(c), respectively. Both mock-transfected and PrP(c)-expressing cell lines produced an 11-12-kDa PrP fragment (referred to as N1), the immunological characterization of which strongly suggests that it corresponds to the N-terminal PrP(c) fragment derived from normal processing. We have established that the recovery of secreted N1 is increased by the protein kinase C agonists PDBu and PMA in a time- and dose-dependent manner in both cell lines. In contrast, secretion of N1 remains unaffected by the inactive PDBu analog alphaPDD and by the protein kinase A effectors dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin.

Leptin, the ob gene product, provides a molecular basis for the lipostatic theory of the regulation of energy balance. Leptin circulates as a monomeric 16 kDa protein in rodent and human plasma and is also bound to leptin binding proteins that may form large high molecular weight complexes. Initial models of leptin action included leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and leptin-insensitive db/db mice. Peripheral or central administration of leptin reduced body weight, adiposity, and food intake in ob/ob mice but not in db/db mice. In ob/ob mice leptin treatment restored fertility. Leptin interacts with many messenger molecules in the brain. For example, leptin suppresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the arcuate nucleus. Increased NPY activity has an inhibitory effect on the gonadotropin axis and represents a direct mechanism for inhibiting sexual maturation and reproductive function in conditions of food restriction and/or energy expenditure. By modulating the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis both directly and indirectly, leptin may thus serve as the signal from fat to the brain about the adequacy of fat stores for pubertal development and reproduction. Normal leptin secretion is necessary for normal reproductive function to proceed and leptin may be a signal allowing for the point of initiation of and progression toward puberty.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [leptin protein] and [neuropeptide Y protein] interact with each other?

Obesity is rapidly becoming a worldwide epidemic, with significant consequences in terms of clinical burden and economic costs in treating its complications, so effective new approaches are urgently needed. Development of new drugs in this therapeutic area requires a detailed understanding of the physiology underlying body weight regulation. Recently several significant advances have been made in this area, including the identification of the appetite regulating hormone, leptin, and a detailed understanding of its targets in the central nervous system (CNS), such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the melanocortin-4 receptor. The observation that some humans with severe childhood-onset obesity have defects in these regulatory systems has confirmed their relevance in humans as well as in animal models, and the search is now on to produce drugs which act on these and other CNS targets such as glucagon-like peptide I and the orexins to help reduce body weight. Other recently identified targets outside the central nervous system include agents acting to inhibit digestive enzymes, specifically pancreatic lipase in the form of orlistat (which has recently been licensed for obesity treatment), and looking to the future, the possibility of altering energy expenditure by modulating the newly identified uncoupling proteins is being considered.

Regulatory thermogenesis occurs upon exposure to the cold or during food intake. Among a variety of mechanisms leading to heat production, uncoupling of respiration in brown adipocyte mitochondria appears to be a major contributor to resistance to the cold in rodents. This uncoupling mechanism is due to the activity of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), a specific carrier present in the inner membrane of mitochondria. The recent identification of UCP-2 and UCP-3, two homologues of the brown fat UCP, suggested that respiration uncoupling could contribute to thermogenesis in most tissues. Activity and expression of the three UCP's are stimulated by several neuromediators and hormones such as noradrenaline, tri-iodothyronine and leptin.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [UCP protein] and [leptin protein] interact with each other?

Obese subjects exhibit a marked decrease in plasma growth hormone (GH) levels. However, the mechanisms by which increased adiposity leads to an impairment of GH secretion are poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that the adipose tissue can markedly influence GH secretion via two different signals, namely free fatty acids (FFA) and leptin. FFA appear to inhibit GH secretion mainly by acting directly at pituitary level. Interestingly, reduction in circulating FFA levels in obese subjects led to a marked increase in GH responses to different GH secretagogues. This indicates that FFA exert a tonic inhibitory effect that contributes to blunted GH secretion in obese subjects. Recent data have shown that leptin is a metabolic signal that regulates GH secretion, since the administration of leptin antiserum to adult rats led to a marked decrease in spontaneous GH secretion. However, leptin prevents,the inhibitory effect exerted by fasting on plasma GH levels. The effect of leptin in adult rats appears to be exerted at hypothalamic level by regulating growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), somatostatin and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-producing neurones. In addition, during fetal life or following the development of pituitary tumors, leptin can also act directly at the anterior pituitary.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [leptin protein] and [neuropeptide Y protein] interact with each other?

During a dynamic perifusion, 20 mmol/L glucose, 20 mmol/L alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC) or 20 mmol/L methyl pyruvate (MP) stimulate biphasic insulin secretory responses from collagenase-isolated rat islets. Peak first-phase insulin responses were comparable for all 3 nutrient agonists. The largest second-phase insulin secretory response was evoked by 20 mmol/L glucose (30-fold above basal release rates), and this response was more sustained than that observed with either 20 mmol/L KIC or 20 mmol/L MP. When mouse islets were perifused under similar conditions, KIC stimulated the largest first-phase insulin response, while comparable acute insulin secretion rates were obtained with glucose- or MP-stimulated islets. In contrast to rat islets, the sustained second phase of insulin secretion from mouse islets was minimal regardless of the nutrient secretagogue used. This anomalous response of mouse islets as compared with rat islets could not be ascribed to any obvious difference in the glucose usage rate or insulin content between these 2 species. Glucose, KIC, or MP stimulated significant increases in 3H-inositol phosphates in rat islets. Significantly smaller increases were measured in mouse islets. Comparative Western blot analyses showed pronounced species differences in the expression of phospholipase Cbeta1 (PLCbeta1), PLCbeta2, PLCbeta3, and PLCdelta1 but not PLCgamma1 or protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) between rat and mouse islets. PLCbeta4 or PLCdelta2 could not be identified in either species.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether the anorexic and thermogenic effects of leptin were attenuated in overweight aged rats following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of murine leptin. Male F344/BN rats of two ages (6 months: young (n=20) and 24 months: old (n=18)) were divided into three groups (control, pair-fed and leptin) and were treated with either vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) or leptin (15.6 microgram/day) for 3 days. There was an age-related increase in basal food intake (20+/-2%), serum leptin levels (363+/-106%) and leptin (OB) mRNA (72+/-16%) in perirenal white adipose tissue (PWAT). In contrast, basal expression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA and brown adipose tissue (BAT) uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) mRNA was reduced significantly (-35+/-4% and -51+/-5%, respectively) with age. I.c.v. leptin treatment had a significantly greater effect in reducing food intake (-42+/-5% vs. -23+/-4%), serum leptin levels (-55+/-7% vs. 10+/-2%) and PWAT OB mRNA (-46+/-2% vs. 10+/-5%) in young than in old rats. Similarly, central leptin treatment also had a greater effect in suppressing hypothalamic NPY mRNA expression in young (-23+/-4%) than in old (-8+/-4%) rats compared with their age-matched pair-fed treated rats. The stimulatory effect of i.c.v. leptin treatment on BAT UCP1 mRNA expression was also significantly greater in young rats (45+/-8%) than in old rats (10+/-6%) compared with age-matched pair-fed rats. Our previous report indicated that these overweight aged rats were resistant to peripheral administered leptin. The present data extend those findings and demonstrate that the impaired anorexic and metabolic effects of leptin are centrally mediated. This leptin resistance may be due to either the elevated obesity and serum leptin with age or due to age itself or both. The development of leptin resistance with age may contribute to the hyperphagia, hyperleptinemia and impaired energy balance with age.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [leptin protein] and [NPY protein] interact with each other?

Previously, we reported that the rice dwarf mutant, d1, is defective in the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein (Galpha). In the present study, gibberellin (GA) signaling in d1 and the role of the Galpha protein in the GA-signaling pathway were investigated. Compared with the wild type, GA induction of alpha-amylase activity in aleurone cells of d1 was greatly reduced. Relative to the wild type, the GA(3)-treated aleurone layer of d1 had lower expression of Ramy1A, which encodes alpha-amylase, and OsGAMYB, which encodes a GA-inducible transcriptional factor, and no increase in expression of Ca(2 +)-ATPase. However, in the presence of high GA concentrations, alpha-amylase induction occurred even in d1. The GA sensitivity of second leaf sheath elongation in d1 was similar to that of the wild type in terms of dose responsiveness, but the response of internode elongation to GA was much lower in d1. Furthermore, Os20ox expression was up-regulated, and the GA content was elevated in the stunted internodes of d1. All these results suggest that d1 affects a part of the GA-signaling pathway, namely the induction of alpha-amylase in the aleurone layer and internode elongation. In addition, a double mutant between d1 and another GA-signaling mutant, slr, revealed that SLR is epistatic to the D1, supporting that the Galpha protein is involved in GA signaling. However, the data also provide evidence for the presence of an alternative GA-signaling pathway that does not involve the Galpha protein.

On the basis of far-Western blot and plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, we show here that recombinant bovine prion protein (bPrP) (25-242) strongly interacts with the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of protein kinase CK2 (also termed 'casein kinase 2'). This association leads to increased phosphotransferase activity of CK2alpha, tested on calmodulin or specific peptides as substrate. We also show that bPrP counteracts the inhibition of calmodulin phosphorylation promoted by the regulatory beta subunits of CK2. A truncated form of bPrP encompassing the C-terminal domain (residues 105-242) interacts with CK2 but does not affect its catalytic activity. The opposite is found with the N-terminal fragment of bPrP (residues 25-116), although the stimulation of catalysis is less efficient than with full-size bPrP.

The physiologic regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is dependent upon the activation of information flow in the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction system. In both rat and human pancreatic beta-cells, glucose has several time-dependent effects on secretory responsiveness including the regulation of biphasic insulin secretion, time-dependent potentiation and time-dependent suppression. PLC/PKC activation has been implicated in all three response patterns. Islets of Langerhans contain the three major PLC isozyme classes (beta1, gamma1 and delta1) and the available evidence suggests that one class is activated by fuel secretagogues and another by neurohumoral agonists. The expression and activation of PLC is labile. When rat islet are cultured for short periods, the content and activation of PLC in response to glucose decreases and this biochemical defect in signal transduction is paralleled by significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin secretion. Similar defects are observed when human islets are cultured as well. Mouse islet responses to glucose stimulation differ in several major and dramatic ways from rat and human islet responses. When stimulated by 15mM glucose, mouse islets fail to develop a rising second phase secretory response, they fail to exhibit either time-dependent potentiation or time-dependent suppression to the hexose. Biphasic insulin secretion can be evoked and time-dependent potentiation can be induced in mouse islets by carbachol, an agonist that activates an isozyme of PLC distinct from that activated by glucose. These divergent response patterns are attributable to the underexpression in mouse islets, when compared to rat islets, of a fuel-sensitive PLC isozyme. When taken in their entirety, the experimental evidence suggests that the activation of PLC is an essential component in the physiologic regulation of insulin secretion and that disordered activation of the enzyme culminates in disordered insulin release.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [insulin protein] and [PLC protein] interact with each other?

The effects of the posterior-pituitary peptides oxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and lysine-vasopressin (LVP) on insulin and glucagon secretion were examined in adult sheep. Each peptide was injected intravenously at doses from 1 to 3000 pmol kg-1. All three peptides increased plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations, but their dose-response relationships revealed differences between them. The maximal insulin responses induced by OT and AVP were very similar, but the threshold and maximal doses of AVP for increasing plasma insulin were higher than those of OT. OT and AVP had the same activity for stimulating glucagon secretion in respect of the threshold and maximal doses and the maximal hormone response. LVP also increased plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations, but it had the weakest activity for stimulating both hormones. These results suggest that in sheep posterior-pituitary peptide may play a role in regulating nutrient metabolism by influencing pancreatic hormone secretion.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [insulin protein] and [OT protein] interact with each other?

Hypersecretion of insulin from the pancreas is among the earliest detectable metabolic alterations in some genetically obese animals including the ob/ob mouse and in some obesity-prone humans. Since the primary cause of obesity in the ob/ob mouse is a lack of leptin due to a mutation in the ob gene, we tested the hypothesis that leptin targets a regulatory pathway in pancreatic islets to prevent hypersecretion of insulin. Insulin secretion is regulated by changes in blood glucose, as well as by peptides from the gastrointestinal tract and neurotransmitters that activate the pancreatic islet adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and phospholipase C (PLC) (e.g., acetylcholine) signaling pathways to further potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion.

Pure quercetin and grape-derived beverages restored proliferation in the presence of MM-LDL and prevented the apoptosis otherwise induced by lovastatin.

The mechanism of arginine vasopressin (AVP) action in Leydig cells was investigated, and compared to the effects of phorbol-13-myristate-12-acetate (PMA) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Previous reports suggested that AVP inhibits Leydig cell testosterone production at the level of 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17-lyase activity. The present study confirms and extends these observations, and contrasts the effects of AVP to IL-1. In all experiments, macrophage-depleted Leydig cells were isolated from mice and maintained in primary culture for 5 d prior to initiation of treatments. Leydig cells were treated with 8-Br-cAMP plus increasing concentrations of AVP or IL-1 beta. AVP caused a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of cAMP-stimulated testosterone production and P450c17 mRNA expression. IL-1 beta completely inhibited cAMP-stimulated testosterone production and P450c17 mRNA expression. PMA is a known activator of protein kinase C (PKC) and has been reported to inhibit Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Leydig cells express type V1 vasopressin receptors, which are coupled to PKC activation. The mechanism of IL-1 action in Leydig cells is not understood, but activation of the PKC pathway has been suggested for IL-1 action in other systems. Therefore, the effects of PMA on cAMP-stimulated steroidogenesis were compared to AVP and IL-1. Similar to the effects of AVP, PMA inhibited cAMP-stimulated testosterone production and P450c17 mRNA expression. To assess the possible involvement of PKC in AVP and IL-1 action in Leydig cells, the PKC inhibitor Calphostin C was tested. cAMP-stimulated testosterone production and P450c17 mRNA expression were significantly inhibited by 10 nM AVP (p < 0.05), and this inhibition was reversed by treatment with Calphostin C. Analogous experiments were performed to assess the role of PKC in IL-1 action. In contrast to the results for AVP, Calphostin C did not reverse the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on cAMP-stimulated P450c17 mRNA expression. To assess further PKC activation, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) phosphorylation was analyzed. Only AVP and PMA, but not IL-1 beta, caused an increase in MARCKS phosphorylation. These results confirm that AVP and PMA activate PKC and indicate that IL-1 likely does not activate PKC in Leydig cells. The implications of AVP-mediated inhibition of steroidogenesis and potential role of MARCKS phosphorylation are discussed.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [PKC protein] and [AVP protein] interact with each other?

The mechanism of arginine vasopressin (AVP) action in Leydig cells was investigated, and compared to the effects of phorbol-13-myristate-12-acetate (PMA) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Previous reports suggested that AVP inhibits Leydig cell testosterone production at the level of 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17-lyase activity. The present study confirms and extends these observations, and contrasts the effects of AVP to IL-1. In all experiments, macrophage-depleted Leydig cells were isolated from mice and maintained in primary culture for 5 d prior to initiation of treatments. Leydig cells were treated with 8-Br-cAMP plus increasing concentrations of AVP or IL-1 beta. AVP caused a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of cAMP-stimulated testosterone production and P450c17 mRNA expression. IL-1 beta completely inhibited cAMP-stimulated testosterone production and P450c17 mRNA expression. PMA is a known activator of protein kinase C (PKC) and has been reported to inhibit Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Leydig cells express type V1 vasopressin receptors, which are coupled to PKC activation. The mechanism of IL-1 action in Leydig cells is not understood, but activation of the PKC pathway has been suggested for IL-1 action in other systems. Therefore, the effects of PMA on cAMP-stimulated steroidogenesis were compared to AVP and IL-1. Similar to the effects of AVP, PMA inhibited cAMP-stimulated testosterone production and P450c17 mRNA expression. To assess the possible involvement of PKC in AVP and IL-1 action in Leydig cells, the PKC inhibitor Calphostin C was tested. cAMP-stimulated testosterone production and P450c17 mRNA expression were significantly inhibited by 10 nM AVP (p < 0.05), and this inhibition was reversed by treatment with Calphostin C. Analogous experiments were performed to assess the role of PKC in IL-1 action. In contrast to the results for AVP, Calphostin C did not reverse the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on cAMP-stimulated P450c17 mRNA expression. To assess further PKC activation, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) phosphorylation was analyzed. Only AVP and PMA, but not IL-1 beta, caused an increase in MARCKS phosphorylation. These results confirm that AVP and PMA activate PKC and indicate that IL-1 likely does not activate PKC in Leydig cells. The implications of AVP-mediated inhibition of steroidogenesis and potential role of MARCKS phosphorylation are discussed.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [AVP protein] and [PKC protein] interact with each other?

The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) contain the major 'biological clock' in mammals that controls most circadian rhythms expressed by these animals. The functional importance of protein phosphorylation and intracellular Ca2+ in the mammalian circadian pacemaker is becoming increasingly apparent. Here we report the immunocytochemical localization of the four Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (alpha, betaI, betaII, gamma) within the SCN of the diurnal murid rodent, Arvicanthis niloticus, and the nocturnal golden hamster. In the SCN of A. niloticus, PKCalpha was the most abundant of the four isoforms. Cells containing PKCalpha were homogeneously distributed throughout the SCN. PKCbetaI cells were sparsely distributed in the perimeter of the SCN and were absent in its central area. PKCbetaII and -gamma were not found in the SCN of A. niloticus. In the SCN of the golden hamster, PKCalpha cells were most heavily concentrated in the dorsomedial region, though some were also present laterally and ventrally. The distribution of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) cells in the SCN overlapped with that of PKC in both species. Species differences in the location of the Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms suggest differences in function such as the relaying of photic or non-photic information to the clock mechanism, or the synchronization of AVP neurons and their subsequent output signals.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [arginine-vasopressin protein] and [PKC protein] interact with each other?

Transcriptional regulation of the oxytocin and oxytocin receptor genes underly to a large degree the highly specific and often transient physiologies associated with this peptide hormone system. Using a variety of homologous transcription assays we have endeavoured to identify and characterize the cis and trans elements responsible for the regulation in vivo of the oxytocin peptide gene and the gene for the oxytocin receptor. The bovine ovarian granulosa cell model is a primary culture system where under stimulation by insulin or IGF-I and LH the endogenous oxytocin gene is massively upregulated. We have identified a proximal response element at -160, which in vivo binds the competing nuclear receptors, SF1 and COUP-TF. Additionally ovarian specific transcription factors bind at two additional sites in the distal promoter region. For the bovine oxytocin receptor gene, we have taken advantage of the high endogenous expression of the receptor in the endometrium of the estrous cycle. Using a combination of primary cell culture techniques and in vitro binding of nuclear protein extracts from tissues expressing the receptor in vivo, we have shown there to be a combination of constitutive and inhibitory elements controlling oxytocin receptor gene expression.

Since oxytocin may enhance the activity of centrally located alpha2-adrenoreceptors, a second aim of this study was to explore whether these receptors are involved in the effects. For this purpose, oxytocin (1.0 mg/kg) or NaCl was given subcutaneously (s.c.) once a day during 5 days to male rats.

The mechanism of arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release was examined in the cardiac myoblast cell line, H9c2. Stimulation of cells with AVP induced dose-dependent AA release, and this effect was completely inhibited by the V1 receptor antagonist, d(CH)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP. AVP also produced dose-dependent stimulation of inositol phosphate formation; this was not affected by pertussis toxin, indicating the presence of the V1 receptor/Gq protein/PLCbeta pathway in H9c2 cells. The concentration-response curves for these two effects of AVP overlapped. AVP induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i, followed by a sustained increase. The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 or ionomycin, mimicked the effect of AVP, whereas the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, TPA, only induced a slight increase in AA release. Both the AVP- or A23187-stimulated AA release and the AVP-induced sustained [Ca2+]i increase were completely blocked in the absence of external Ca2+. The receptor-operated Ca2+ channel blocker, SKF 96365, and the inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers, Ca2+ and Ni2+, also inhibited the AVP-induced AA release.

It has been suggested that insulin secretion from pancreatic islets may be mediated in part by activation of phospholipases C (PLCs) and phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the relatively modest fuel-stimulated insulin secretion responses of rodent beta-cell lines might be explained by inadequate expression or activation of PLC isoforms. We have found that two insulinoma cell lines, INS-1 and betaG 40/110, completely lack PLC-delta1 expression but have levels of expression of PLC-beta1, -beta2, -beta3, -delta2, and -gamma1 that are similar to or slightly reduced from those found in fresh rat islets. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PLC-delta1, -beta1, or -beta3 in INS-1 or betaG 40/110 cells results in little or no enhancement in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and no improvement in insulin secretion when the cells are stimulated with glucose or carbachol, despite the fact that the overexpressed proteins are fully active in cell extracts. Overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3 in normal rat islets elicits a larger increase in IP accumulation but, again, has no effect on insulin secretion. Because the effect of carbachol on insulin secretion is thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11 class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3. Overexpression of G11alpha enhances IP accumulation, an effect slightly potentiated by co-overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3, but these maneuvers do not affect glucose or carbachol-stimulated insulin secretion. In sum, our studies show a lack of correlation between IP accumulation and insulin secretion in INS-1 cells, betaG 40/110 cells, or cultured rat islets.

In cereals, gibberellin (GA) enhances the synthesis and secretion of hydrolytic enzymes from aleurone cells. These enzymes then mobilize the endosperm storage reserves that fuel germination. The dose-response curve of aleurone protoplasts to GA extends over a range of concentrations from 10(-11) to more than 10(-6) M. One hypothesis is that subpopulations of cells have different sensitivities to GA, with each cell having a threshold concentration of GA above which it is switched on. The dose-response curve therefore reflects a gradual recruitment of cells to the pool exhibiting a full GA response. Alternatively, all cells may gradually increase their responses as the GA level is increased. In the present study we found that at increasing GA concentrations, increasing numbers of barley (Hordeum vulgare) cells showed the enhanced amylase secretion and vacuolation characteristic of the GA response. We also observed that the region of aleurone tissue closest to the embryo contains the highest proportion of cells activated at the GA concentrations thought to occur naturally in germinating grain. These data indicate that an aleurone layer contains cells of varying sensitivities to GA and that recruitment of these differentially responding pools of cells may explain the broad dose response to GA.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [GA protein] and [amylase protein] interact with each other?

Leptin, the ob gene product that can decrease caloric intake and increase energy expenditure, is functionally released by insulin from adipose tissue. Adenosine is thought to be an important regulator of the action of insulin in adipose tissue. The present study investigated the role of adenosine in the release of leptin by insulin in isolated rat white adipocytes. Release of leptin, measured by radioimmunoassay, from insulin-stimulated samples was seen after 30 min. Adenosine deaminase, at concentrations sufficient to metabolize endogenous adenosine, decreased insulin-stimulated leptin release. Also, the insulin-stimulated leptin release was completely blocked by the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX). Mediation of endogenous adenosine in this action of insulin was further supported by the assay of adenosine released into the medium from adipocytes stimulated with insulin. In addition, activation of adenosine A1 receptors by N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) induced an increase in leptin release in a concentration-dependent manner that could be blocked by antagonists, either DPCPX or 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8-SPT). In the presence of U73312, a specific inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC), CPA-stimulated leptin secretion from adipocytes was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner, but it was not affected by U73343, the negative control for U73312. Moreover, chelerythrine and GF 109203X diminished the CPA-stimulated leptin secretion at concentrations sufficient to inhibit protein kinase C (PKC). These results suggest that, in isolated white adipocytes, the released adenosine acts as a helper and/or a positive regulator for insulin in the release of leptin via an activation of adenosine A1 receptors that involves the PLC-PKC pathway.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [insulin protein] and [PLC protein] interact with each other?

A(beta) (1-40) enhanced the level of malondialdehyde indicating an activation of free radical stimulated membrane lipid peroxidation that may be involved in alteration of phospholipase(s) activity. Our results indicated that aggregated A(beta) (1-40) alters Ca(2+)-dependent phosphoinositide degradation affecting synaptic plasma membrane and cytosolic phospholipase(s) activity. Moreover, this peptide significantly decreased the phosphoinositide-dependent signal transduction mediated by cholinergic receptors. The effect of aggregated A(beta) (1-40) is more pronounced than that of the neurotoxic fragment A(beta) (25-35). Our study suggests that the deposition of aggregated A(beta) may alter phosphoinositide signaling in brain.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [A(beta) (1-40) protein] and [PIP2-PLC protein] interact with each other? NOTE: Always begin your response with 'YES' or 'NO', indicating if the two terms in the are interacting in a similar way to the interacting or non-interacting examples, along with a confidence level (e.g., low, medium, high). If two names belong to the same entity, do not consider them as interacting. Examples: Interacting: "The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib "triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA" and that the combination "enhanced" the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which indicates that the two drugs interact to produce a combined effect on the leukemia cells that is different from the effect of either drug alone."

[NO, high confidence] Explanation: ...[/INST]	YES, high confidence; Explanation: The context indicates that aggregated A(beta) (1-40) significantly decreased the activity of the PIP2-PLC in synaptic plasma membranes. This suggests that A(beta) (1-40) interacts with PIP2-PLC, affecting its activity. The decrease in enzyme activity implies a direct interaction between the two proteins, where A(beta) (1-40) alters the function of PIP2-PLC.</s>

Obesity occurs in 60% of women after menopause and is characterized by an excess of adipose tissue that depends on several orexigenic (neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates carbohydrate ingestion, galanin stimulates fat intake) and anorectic (leptin, cholecystokinin (CCK)) factors. Both leptin and insulin can reduce hypothalamic NPY production and secretion. Behavior related to the consumption of food is probably attributed to the NPY-galanin signalling route. We investigated basal levels of serum leptin, CCK, galanin and NPY in 16 non-obese premenopausal women, in 15 obese premenopausal women (body mass index (BMI) 34.6 +/- 1.3 SD) and in ten obese postmenopausal women (BMI 34.7 +/- 1.5 SD) to determine the relationship between obesity, menopause and these neuropeptides. Obese premenopausal women had three-fold elevations of serum leptin (32.1 +/- 3.2 ng/ml) in comparison to non-obese premenopausal women (10.3 +/- 1.5 ng/ml), but similar levels to those in obese postmenopausal women (35.3 +/- 4.1 ng/ml). In all 44 patients and in both sub-groups of premenopausal and postmenopausal women, serum leptin exhibited a strong positive correlation with BMI (r = 0.8692, p < 0.0001; r = 0.8803, p = 0.0001; r = 0.8184, p = 0.0001, respectively). Serum galanin values showed a statistically significant increment in the obese postmenopausal group (51.1 +/- 8.1 pg/ml) compared to both premenopausal groups: the non-obese (34.9 +/- 5.8 pg/ml) and the obese (36.0 +/- 5.5 pg/ml). Non-obese menstruating women demonstrated NPY levels (175.0 +/- 12.8 pg/ml) significantly higher than those of obese premenopausal women (126.0 +/- 12.1 pg/ml) and obese postmenopausal women (138.1 +/- 15.4 pg/ml). CCK values showed no differences between non-obese and obese pre- and postmenopausal groups. Basal insulin values were elevated in both obese groups compared to non-obese premenopausal women. Significantly increased leptin and galanin levels in postmenopausal obese women coupled with decreased NPY levels revealed some changes in the neuropeptides regulating eating behavior, which may be the reason for the onset of postmenopausal obesity.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [leptin protein] and [NPY protein] interact with each other?

Leptin may rapidly inhibit food intake by altering the secretion of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stimulator of food intake, and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an inhibitor of food intake. We measured concentrations of NPY and CRH in specific hypothalamic regions [i.e., arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus] of 7- to 8-wk-old lean and ob/ob mice at 1 or 3 h after intracerebroventricular leptin administration. No rapid-onset effects of leptin on hypothalamic NPY or CRH concentrations were observed in intact mice. The addition of leptin to hypothalamic preparations from intact mice also did not alter NPY or CRH secretion. Glucocorticoids may oppose leptin actions. Consistent with this, leptin administration to adrenalectomized mice markedly reduced CRH concentrations in the ARC within 3 h after injection. This rapid reduction in CRH concentration in the ARC after leptin administration is more likely due to stimulated CRH release from this region than to decreased synthesis/transport from the PVN because leptin stimulates CRH synthesis in the PVN. Within 20 min after exposure to leptin, NPY secretion from hypothalamic preparations obtained from adrenalectomized mice was lowered by 27% and CRH secretion was elevated by 51%. The current study demonstrates that leptin rapidly influences the secretion of hypothalamic NPY and CRH and that these actions of leptin within the hypothalamus are restrained by the presence of endogenous corticosterone.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Leptin protein] and [Neuropeptide Y protein] interact with each other?
