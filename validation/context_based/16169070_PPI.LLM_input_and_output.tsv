2A2594884 2A2685847	hexokinase	Notch1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 30140438 Hexokinase 2 is dispensable for T cell-dependent immunity. Background: T cells and cancer cells utilize glycolysis for proliferation. The hexokinase (1-4) family of enzymes catalyze the first step of glycolysis. Hexokinase 2 is one of the most highly upregulated metabolic enzymes in both cancer and activated T cells. Hexokinase 2 is required for the development and/or growth of cancer in several cancer models, but the necessity of hexokinase 2 in T cells is not fully understood. The clinical applicability of hexokinase 2 inhibition in cancer may be significantly limited by any potential negative effects of hexokinase 2 inhibition on T cells. Therefore, we investigated the necessity of hexokinase 2 for T cell function. In order to identify additional therapeutic cancer targets, we performed RNA-seq to compare in vivo proliferating T cells to T cell leukemia. Methods: hexokinase 2 was genetically ablated in mouse T cells using a floxed Hk2 allele crossed to CD4-Cre. CD4+ and CD8+ cells from mice were characterized metabolically and tested in vitro. T cell function in vivo was tested in a mouse model of colitis, Th2-mediated lung inflammation, and viral infection. Treg function was tested by crossing Hk2-floxed mice to FoxP3-Cre mice. Hematopoietic function was tested by deleting hexokinase 2 from bone marrow with Vav1-iCre. RNA-seq was used to compare T cells proliferating in response to virus with primary T-ALL leukemia induced with mutant Notch1 expression. Results: We unexpectedly report that hexokinase 2 is largely dispensable for in vitro T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Loss of hexokinase 2 does not impair in vivo viral immunity and causes only a small impairment in the development of pathological inflammation. Hexokinase 2 is not required for Treg function or hematopoiesis in vivo. One hundred sixty-seven metabolic genes were identified as being differentially expressed between T cells and leukemia. Conclusions: hexokinase 2 is a highly upregulated enzyme in cancer and in T cells. The requirement for hexokinase 2 in various cancer models has been described previously. Our finding that T cells are able to withstand the loss of hexokinase 2 indicates that hexokinase 2 may be a promising candidate for cancer therapy.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [hexokinase protein] and [Notch1 protein] interact with each other?

2A2863190 2A2905922	SIVA1	FAS	[INST]Context: [PMID: 17677004 Divergent evolution of human p53 binding sites: cell cycle versus apoptosis. The p53 tumor suppressor is a sequence-specific pleiotropic transcription factor that coordinates cellular responses to DNA damage and stress, initiating cell-cycle arrest or triggering apoptosis. Although the human p53 binding site sequence (or response element ) is well characterized, some genes have consensus-poor REs that are nevertheless both necessary and sufficient for transactivation by p53. We evaluated the comparative genomics approach for assessing evolutionary conservation of putative binding sites by examining conservation of 83 experimentally validated human p53 REs against mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog genomes and detected pronounced conservation differences among p53 REs and p53-regulated pathways. Bona fide NRF2 (nuclear factor [erythroid-derived 2]-like 2 nuclear factor) and NFkappaB (nuclear factor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B cells) binding sites, which direct oxidative stress and innate immunity responses, were used as controls, and both exhibited high interspecific conservation. Surprisingly, the average p53 response element was not significantly more conserved than background genomic sequence, and p53 REs in apoptosis genes as a group showed very little conservation. Examination of interspecific DNA base substitutions as a function of position in the p53 consensus sequence reveals an unexpected excess of diversity in apoptosis-regulating REs versus cell-cycle controlling REs (rodent comparisons: p < 1.0 e-12). While some p53 REs show relatively high levels of conservation, REs in many genes such as BAX, FAS, PCNA, CASP6, SIVA1, and P53AIP1 show little if any homology to rodent sequences. Overall our results reveal divergent evolutionary pressure among the binding targets of p53 and emphasize that comparative genomics methods must be used judiciously and tailored to the evolutionary history of the targeted functional regulatory regions.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SIVA1 protein] and [FAS protein] interact with each other?

The present study aimed to investigate the influence of SHP-1 on the radioresistance of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE-2 and the relevant underlying mechanisms. The human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE-2 was transfected with a lentivirus that contained the SHP-1 gene or a nonsense sequence (referred to as LP-H1802Lv201 and LP-NegLv201 cells, respectively). Cell survival, DNA double-strand breaks, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and the expression of related proteins were assessed using colony formation assay, immunofluorescent assays, flow cytometry and western blot analyses, respectively. Compared with the control (CNE-2 cells) and LP-NegLv201 cells, LP-H1802Lv201 cells were more resistant to ionizing radiation. Immunofluorescent assays showed that ionizing radiation caused less histone H2AX phosphorylation (gammaH2AX) and RAD51 foci in the LP-H1802Lv201 cells. Compared with the control and LP-NegLv201 cells, LP-H1802Lv201 cells showed increased S phase arrest. Western blot analyses showed that ionizing radiation increased the phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase, checkpoint kinase 2, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein, checkpoint kinase 1 and p53. In LP-H1802Lv201 cells, the phosphorylation levels of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and checkpoint kinase 2 were significantly increased while the p53 phosphorylation level was decreased compared to these levels in the control and LP-NegLv201 cells. Phosphorylation of and rad3-related and checkpoint kinase 1 did not show significant differences in the three cell groups. Overexpression of SHP-1 in the CNE-2 cells led to radioresistance and the radioresistance was related to enhanced DNA DSB repair, increased S phase arrest and decreased cell apoptosis.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [histone H2AX protein] and [SHP-1 protein] interact with each other?

2A2735098 2A2763256	PPIA	RACK1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 24957886 A multiparametric serum marker panel as a complementary test to mammography for the diagnosis of node-negative early-stage breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ in young women. BACKGROUND: The sensitivity of mammography for the detection of small lesions, including node-negative early-stage (T1N0) primary breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ, is significantly decreased in young patients. From a clinical standpoint, an inconclusive mammogram reflects the inability of clinicians to confidently decide whether patients should be referred for biopsy or for follow-up with repeat imaging. METHODS: Specific ELISAs were developed for a panel of 13 well-recognized breast autoantigens (HSP60, FKBP52, PRDX2, PPIA, MUC1, GAL3, PAK2, P53, CCNB1, PHB2, RACK1, RUVBL1, and HER2). Circulating autoantibody levels were measured in a cohort of 396 serum samples from histologically confirmed ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 87) or T1N0 primary breast cancer (n = 153) and healthy controls (n = 156). RESULTS: Individually, antibodies against CCNB1, FKBP52, GAL3, PAK2, PRDX2, PPIA, P53, and MUC1 demonstrated discriminatory power between breast cancer and healthy control groups. Adjustment for higher sensitivities of 95% and 99% resulted in 30% and 21% specificities, respectively (33% and 18% in T1N0 primary breast cancer and 28% and 21% in DCIS). Finally, in patients with node-negative early-stage breast cancer younger than 50 years, the autoantibody assay exhibited 59% specificity with a fixed sensitivity at 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Our autoantibody panel allows accurate detection of early breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ, notably in younger patients.

Microcystin-LR is one of the most toxic cyanotoxins produced in algal blooms. The toxic effects of microcystin-lr on the expression of some organelles genes (mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytoskeleton etc) have been widely investigated, but little is known how it impacts on the expression of ribosomal genes. In this study we identified seven ribosomal protein genes RPS6, RPS12, RPS24, RPS27a, RPL12, RPL27 and RPL29 in bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis), whose expression was regulated by microcystin-lr. The amino acid sequences of those 7 genes shared more than 90% identity with corresponding sequences from zebrafish, and were well conserved throughout evolution. Q-PCR analysis revealed that expression of seven genes changed dramatically at 3 hr, then went back to a moderate change- level at 24 hr in almost all tested tissues (liver, kidney, intestine, heart, spleen and gill) post microcystin-lr injection, but in brain expression of the seven genes stayed same as the normal level.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia, an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by anemia that usually presents before the first birthday or in early childhood, is associated with birth defects and an increased risk of cancer. Although anemia is the most prominent feature of diamond-blackfan anemia, the disease is also characterized by growth retardation and congenital malformations, in particular craniofacial, upper limb, heart, and urinary system defects that are present in approximately 30%-50% of patients. Diamond-blackfan anemia has been associated with mutations in seven ribosomal protein genes, RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL35A, RPL5, RPL11, and RPS7, in about 43% of patients.

Mesangial cells play an active role in the inflammatory response to glomerular injury. We have studied in cultured human mesangial cells several effects of 9-cis retinoic acid, an activator of both retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors . 9-cis retinoic acid inhibited foetal calf serum-induced cultured human mesangial cells proliferation. It also prevented cultured human mesangial cells death induced by the inflammatory mediator H(2)O(2). This preventive effect was not due to any increase in H(2)O(2) catabolism and it persisted even when both catalase and glutathione synthesis were inhibited. Finally, 9-cis retinoic acid diminished monocyte adhesion to FCS-stimulated cultured human mesangial cells. Interestingly, the retinoid also inhibited in FCS-stimulated cells the protein expression of two mesangial adhesion molecules, fibronectin and osteopontin, but it did not modify the protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1. All major retinoic acid receptors and retinoid x receptors isotypes were expressed in cultured human mesangial cells regardless of the presence or absence of 9-cis retinoic acid. Transcripts to RAR-alpha, RAR-beta and RXR-alpha increased after incubation with 9-cis retinoic acid whereas RXR-gamma was inhibited, suggesting a major role for retinoic acid receptors and retinoid x receptors in 9-cRA-anti-inflammatory effects. Cell death occurred by apoptosis, whose onset was associated with a pronounced increase in catalase activity and reduced glutathione content, being more effectively induced by all-trans retinoic acid.

BACKGROUND: Phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma 2 (PPP1CC2), a PPP1CC tissue-specific alternative splice restricted to testicular germ cells and spermatozoa, is essential for spermatogenesis and spermatozoa motility. The key to understand PPP1CC2 regulation lies on the characterization of its interacting partners. Further the interaction of a potential target for pharmacological intervention was validated in human spermatozoa. In the network, PPP1CC was located in the fourth maximum core part (k=41) and had 106 direct interactors. Sixteen PPP1CC interactors were involved in spermatogenesis-related categories. Also, PPP1CC had 50 direct interactors, highly interconnected and many of them part of the network maximum core (k=44), associated with motility-related annotations, including several previously uncharacterized interactors, such as, LMNA, JAK2 and RIPK3. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we integrated tissue-specific protein expression and protein-protein interaction data in order to identify key PPP1CC2 complexes for male reproductive functions.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The augmenter of liver regeneration protein is critical for lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial function. We investigated high-fat/high-carbohydrate diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in wild-type, hepatocyte-specific ALR-knockout, and ALR-heterozygous mice. Augmenter of liver regeneration was measured in serum of human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and NASH-induced cirrhosis (serum and liver). APPROACH AND RESULTS: high-fat/high-carbohydrate feeding decreased augmenter of liver regeneration expression in all groups of mice. The otherwise normal alr-heterozygous mice gained more weight and steatosis than wild-type mice when challenged metabolically with the high-fat/high-carbohydrate diet; Alr-knockout mice gained the least weight and had the least steatosis. These findings were consistent with correspondingly increased triglycerides and cholesterol and altered expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, sterol regulatory element-binding protein, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase. All HF/HC-fed mice developed insulin resistance, the magnitude being lower in alr-knockout mice. HF/HC-fed alr-heterozygous mice were more resistant to glucose challenge than wild-type or alr-knockout mice. The frequency of tumor necrosis factor alpha-producing, interleukin 6 -producing, and IL17-producing cells was greater in alr-knockout than alr-heterozygous and lowest in wild-type mice. High-fat/high-carbohydrate feeding did not increase their number in alr-knockout mice, and the increase in alr-heterozygous was greater than that in wild-type mice except for IL17 cells. Cluster of differentiation 25-positive (cluster of differentiation 25-positive ) forkhead box P3-positive CD4+ regulatory T-cell frequency was lower in alr-heterozygous than wild-type mice and further reduced in alr-knockout mice; High-fat/high-carbohydrate reduced regulatory T-cell frequency only in wild-type mice. HF/HC-fed alr-heterozygous, but not wild-type, mice developed fibrosis; And alr-knockout mice progressed to cirrhosis. White adipose tissue of HF/HC-fed ALR-deficient mice developed strong inflammation, indicating bidirectional interactions with the liver. Hepatic and serum augmenter of liver regeneration levels were significantly reduced in patients with NASH-cirrhosis. Serum augmenter of liver regeneration was also significantly lower in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

Augmenter of liver regeneration is a thermostable cytokine that was originally identified to promote the growth of hepatocytes. This study was conducted to explore the expression and function of augmenter of liver regeneration in multiple myeloma, a common hematologic malignancy. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were performed to detect the expression of augmenter of liver regeneration in U266 human multiple myeloma cells and healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells . U266 multiple myeloma cells were exposed to 20 or 40 mug/mL of recombinant augmenter of liver regeneration and tested for cell proliferation. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of augmenter of liver regeneration was done to investigate the role of augmenter of liver regeneration in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cytokine production. Compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells, U266 multiple myeloma cells exhibited significantly higher levels of augmenter of liver regeneration at both the mRNA and protein levels. The addition of recombinant augmenter of liver regeneration protein significantly promoted the proliferation of U266 cells. In contrast, knockdown of augmenter of liver regeneration led to a significant decline in the viability and proliferation of U266 cells. Annexin-V/PI staining analysis demonstrated that augmenter of liver regeneration downregulation increased apoptosis in U266 multiple myeloma cells, compared to control cells (20.1_+-1.1 vs 9.1_+-0.3%, P<0.05). Moreover, augmenter of liver regeneration depletion reduced the Bcl-2 mRNA level by 40% and raised the Bax mRNA level by 2-fold. Additionally, conditioned medium from ALR-depleted U266 cells had significantly lower concentrations of interleukin-6 than control cells (P<0.05).

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant tumors of the digestive system, with insidious, rapid onset and high mortality. Therefore, in-depth exploration of the potential mechanism affecting the prognosis of pancreatic cancer, and search for biomarkers that can effectively predict the prognosis of pancreatic cancer are of practical clinical importance. The mRNA sequencing data, miRNA sequencing data, methylation data and SNP data of pancreatic cancer patients available in The Cancer Genome Atlas were used for analysis to identify biomarkers that significantly affect the prognosis for the patients. The genes that significantly affected the prognosis of pancreatic cancer were as follows: 5 DmiRNAs (hsa-mir-1179, hsa-mir-1224, hsa-mir-1251, hsa-mir-129-1 and hsa-mir-129-2), 6 DmRNAsandDMsandMethyCor database entries (MAPK8IP2, CPE, DPP6, MSI1, IL20RB and S100A2), and FMN2 gene from differential expressed mRNAs and differential single-nucleotide polymorphism (DmRNAsandDSNPs) database.

2A2400821 2A2871148	glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1	SQSTM1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 32432943 Discovery of a potent SREBF chaperone degrader that ameliorates HFD-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance via an autophagy-independent lysosomal pathway. SREBF chaperone regulates SREBFs (sterol regulatory element binding transcription factors) processing and stability, and, thus, becomes an emerging drug target to treat dyslipidemia and fatty liver disease. However, the current known SREBF chaperone inhibitors, such as oxysterols, induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and NR1H3/LXRalpha (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3)-SREBF1/SREBP-1 c-mediated hepatic steatosis, which severely limited the clinical application of this inhibitor. In this study, we identified a small molecule, lycorine, which binds to SREBF chaperone, which suppressed the SREBF pathway without inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress or activating NR1H3. Mechanistically, lycorine promotes SREBF chaperone lysosomal degradation in a macroautophagy/autophagy-independent pathway, a mechanism completely distinct from current SREBF chaperone inhibitors. Furthermore, we determined that SQSTM1 captured SREBF chaperone after its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. The interaction of SREBF chaperone and SQSTM1 requires the WD40 domain of SREBF chaperone and the TB domain of SQSTM1. Interestingly, lycorine triggers the lysosome translocation of SREBF chaperone independent of autophagy. We termed this novel protein degradation pathway as the SQSTM1-mediated autophagy-independent lysosomal degradation pathway. In vivo, lycorine ameliorates high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance in mice. Our study demonstrated that the inhibition of SREBF chaperone through the sqstm1-mediated autophagy-independent lysosomal degradation pathway could be employed as a useful therapeutic strategy for treating metabolic diseases.Abbreviation: 25-OHD: 25-hydroxyvitamin D; 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; ABCG5: ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 5; ABCG8: ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8; ACACA: acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha; APOE: apolipoprotein E; ATF6: activating transcription factor 6; CD274/PD-L1: CD274 molecule; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CQ: chloroquine; DDIT3/CHOP: DNA damage inducible transcript 3; DNL: de novo lipogenesis; EGFR: epithelial growth factor receptor; ERN1/IRE1alpha: endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 1; FADS2: fatty acid desaturase 2; FASN: fatty acid synthase; GOT1/AST: glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1; HMGCR: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; HMGCS1: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1; HSP90B1/GRP94: heat shock protein 90 beta family member 1; INSIG1: insulin induced gene 1; LDLR: low density lipoprotein receptor; LyTACs: lysosome targeting chimeras; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MBTPS1: membrane bound transcription factor peptidase, site 1; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MVK: mevalonate kinase; SCAP: SREBF chaperone; SCD1: stearoyl-coenzemy A desaturase 1; SMAILD: sequestosome 1 mediated autophagy-independent lysosomal degradation; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TNFRSF10B/DR5: TNF receptor superfamily member 10b; TRAF6: TNF receptor associated factor 6; XBP1: X-box binding protein 1.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 protein] and [SQSTM1 protein] interact with each other?

Ferroptosis is a recently recognized form of regulated cell death that is characterized by lipid peroxidation. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating ferroptosis are largely unknown. In this study, we report that the RNA-binding protein ELAVL1/HuR plays a crucial role in regulating ferroptosis in liver fibrosis. Upon exposure to ferroptosis-inducing compounds, ELAVL1 protein expression was remarkably increased through the inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. ELAVL1 siRNA led to ferroptosis resistance, whereas ELAVL1 plasmid contributed to classical ferroptotic events. Interestingly, upregulated ELAVL1 expression also appeared to increase autophagosome generation and macroautophagic/autophagic flux, which was the underlying mechanism for ELAVL1-enhanced ferroptosis. Autophagy depletion completely impaired ELAVL1-mediated ferroptotic events, whereas autophagy induction showed a synergistic effect with ELAVL1. Importantly, ELAVL1 promoted autophagy activation via binding to the AU-rich elements within the F3 of the 3'-untranslated region of BECN1/Beclin1 mRNA. The internal deletion of the F3 region abrogated the ELAVL1-mediated BECN1 mRNA stability, and, in turn, prevented ELAVL1-enhanced ferroptosis. In mice, treatment with sorafenib alleviated murine liver fibrosis by inducing hepatic stellate cell ferroptosis. HSC-specific knockdown of ELAVL1 impaired sorafenib-induced hepatic stellate cell ferroptosis in murine liver fibrosis. Noteworthy, we retrospectively analyzed the effect of sorafenib on hepatic stellate cell ferroptosis in advanced fibrotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving sorafenib monotherapy. Attractively, ELAVL1 upregulation, ferritinophagy activation, and ferroptosis induction occurred in primary human HSCs from the collected human liver tissue. Overall, these results reveal novel molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of ferroptosis, and also identify ELAVL1-autophagy-dependent ferroptosis as a potential target for the treatment of liver fibrosis.

Using bulk RNA-sequencing from whole blood, we examined the association between gene expression and WTC-related posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity on (i) highest lifetime Clinician-Administered posttraumatic stress disorder Scale score, (ii) past-month clinician-administered ptsd scale score, and (iii) posttraumatic stress disorder symptom dimensions using a 5-factor model of re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, dysphoric arousal and anxious arousal symptoms. We identified 66 genes significantly associated with total highest lifetime clinician-administered ptsd scale score (FDR-corrected p___<___0.05), and 31 genes associated with total past-month clinician-administered ptsd scale score. Our more granular analyses of posttraumatic stress disorder symptom dimensions identified additional genes that did not reach statistical significance in our analyses with total clinician-administered ptsd scale scores. Several genes significantly associated with multiple posttraumatic stress disorder symptom dimensions and total lifetime clinician-administered ptsd scale score (SERPINA1, RPS6KA1, and STAT3) have been previously associated with posttraumatic stress disorder. Geneset enrichment of these findings has identified pathways significant in metabolism, immune signaling, other psychiatric disorders, neurological signaling, and cellular structure.

Additionally, cellular deconvolution highlighted an enrichment in CD4 T cells and eosinophils in responders with posttraumatic stress disorder compared to controls. The distinction in significant genes between total lifetime clinician-administered ptsd scale score and the anxious arousal symptom dimension of posttraumatic stress disorder highlights a potential biological difference in the mechanism underlying the heterogeneity of the posttraumatic stress disorder phenotype.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the inhibitory effects of puerarin on angiopoiesis of endometriotic tissue, and to explore the regulatory effects of puerarin on tumor-related gene expression of endometriosis. METHODS: The regulatory effects of puerarin on endometriotic angiopoiesis and tumor-related gene expression were observed by using a chicken chorioallantoic membrane model and gene array method. RESULTS: Chicken chorioallantoic membrane experiment indicated that puerarin obviously inhibited endometriotic vesiculation and angiopoiesis. The expressions of oncogenes and genes related to adhesion, invasion, and apoptosis, including ERBB2, ETS2, FOS, S100A4, TEK, TERT, NFKBIA, CDH1, CD44, ITGA6, NCAM1, MMP1, FLT1, AKT1, BCL2L and BIRC5 genes, were obviously higher, while the expressions of the anti-oncogenes, anti-apoptosis genes and anti-invasion genes, including KAI1, KISS1, SERPINB5, TNFRSF25, TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF6 and SERPINB2, were significantly lower in eutopic endometrial tissue from patients with endometriosis than those from endometriosis-free women. The expressions of oncogenes (ERBB2, ETS2, FOS), apoptosis gene (BCL2L1), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4, CDC25A), and growth factor and receptors (HGF, FGFR2, TGFBR) were significantly enhanced, while the expressions of the anti-oncogenes (KAI1, SERPINB5), apoptosis genes (BAD and TNF) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibiting factor (CDKN2A) were obviously reduced in ectopic tissue as compared with those in eutopic tissue from patients with endometriosis. Puerarin significantly enhanced the gene expressions in endometriotic stromal cells, including BAD, BAX, CASP8, CASP9, TNFRSF6, CDKN1B, CDKN2A, IFNA1 and IFNB1, and reduced the gene expressions of FOS, CHEK2, SRC, ITGB5, MMP9, PDGFA and NFKBIA.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the effect of one-stage full-mouth ultrasonic debridement on clinical and immunoinflammatory parameters in smokers with generalized aggressive periodontitis . METHODS: Fourteen smoking and 14 non-smoking patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis were selected. After initial supragingival therapy, patients were treated by one-stage full-mouth ultrasonic debridement. 2) bleeding scores ; And 4) clinical attachment level . Clinical evaluation was performed, and gingival crevicular fluid was collected for selected sites at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months. Gingival crevicular fluid was analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for: 1) receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL); 2) osteoprotegerin ; 3) interleukin -6; And 4) tumor necrosis factor -alpha, whereas secreted osteoclastogenic factor of activated T-cells (SOFAT) was evaluated by Western blotting. 2) bleeding scores; And 3) probing depth, with no difference between smoking and non-smoking patients (P >0.05). Regarding clinical attachment level, only non-smoking patients showed a significant decrease (P <0.05). And 4) relative clinical attachment level. Smoking and non-smoking patients presented significantly decreased levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha over time (P <0.05); RANKL was significantly different (P <0.05) only for non-smokers at 6 months, whereas osteoprotegerin was not significant (P >0.05). SOFAT expression was significantly lower (P <0.05) after one-stage full-mouth ultrasonic debridement for non-smokers only. CONCLUSION: Considering the clinical and immunoinflammatory parameters evaluated in this short-term follow-up study, it can be concluded that one-stage full-mouth ultrasonic debridement can be used as an alternative treatment for smokers with generalized aggressive periodontitis.

Sirtuin 1, an NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, plays a central role in the control of lipid metabolism in nonruminants. However, the role of sirtuin 1 in hepatic lipid metabolism in dairy cows with fatty liver is not well known. Thus, we used isolated primary bovine hepatocytes to determine the role of sirtuin 1 in protecting cells against oleic acid -induced steatosis. Recombinant adenoviruses to overexpress (AD-GFP-SIRT1-E) or knockdown (AD-GFP-SIRT1-N) sirtuin 1 were used for transduction of hepatocytes. Calf hepatocytes isolated from five female calves (1 d old, 30 to 40 kg) were used to determine both time required and the lowest dose of oleic acid that could induce triacylglycerol accumulation. Analyses indicated that 0.25 mM oleic acid for 24 h was suitable to induce triacylglycerol accumulation. In addition, oleic acid not only led to an increase in triacylglycerol, but also upregulated mRNA and protein abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) and downregulated sirtuin 1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha . Calf hepatocytes were cultured and incubated with oleic acid (0.25 mM) for 24 h, followed by adenoviral AD-GFP-SIRT1-E or AD-GFP-SIRT1-N transduction for 48 h. Overexpression of sirtuin 1 led to greater protein and mRNA abundance of sirtuin 1 along with fatty acid oxidation-related genes including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, retinoid X receptor alpha, and ratio of phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha /total acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha . In contrast, it resulted in lower protein and mRNA abundance of genes related to lipid synthesis including SREBF1, fatty acid synthase, apolipoprotein E, and low-density lipoprotein receptor . The concentration of triacylglycerol decreased due to sirtuin 1 overexpression. In contrast, silencing sirtuin 1 led to lower protein and mRNA abundance of sirtuin 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, retinoid x receptor alpha, and greater protein and mRNA abundance of SREBF1, fatty acid synthase, apolipoprotein e, and low-density lipoprotein receptor. Further, those responses were accompanied by greater content of cellular triacylglycerol and total cholesterol . Overall, data from these in vitro studies indicated that sirtuin 1 is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism in calf hepatocytes subjected to an increase in the supply of oleic acid. Thus, it is possible that alterations in sirtuin 1 abundance and activity in vivo contribute to development of fatty liver in dairy cows.

Rab proteins comprise a family of monomeric GTPases that control cellular membrane traffic. Rab21 is a poorly characterised member with no known function. Human Rab21 cDNA from K562 cells was subcloned into GFP expression vectors to generate Rab21 and Rab21 mutants defective in either GTP hydrolysis (Rab21 Q78L) or binding (Rab21 T33N) for transfection studies in HeLa cells. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and ultrastructural studies revealed Rab21 to be predominantly localised to the early endocytic pathway, on vesicles containing earlyendosomal antigen 1 EEA1, transferrin receptor and internalised ligands. EEA1 was localised to enlarged endosomes in Rab21 wild-type expressing cells but the GTP hydrolysis and GDP binding mutants had unique phenotypes labelling tubular reticular structures and the trans-Golgi network, respectively. Early endosome localisation for Rab21 was confirmed in a hepatoma cell line that allowed analysis of the subcellular distribution of the endogenous protein. Comparison of the localisation of Rab21 with other Rabs revealed extensive colocalisation with early endocytic variants Rab4, Rab5, Rab17 and Rab22 but much less overlap with those associated with late endosomes, recycling endosomes and the early secretory pathway. Cells expressing Rab21 T33N had defects in endocytosis of transferrin and epidermal growth factor and failed to effectively deliver the latter ligand to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation.

Ammonia (NH3) is considered as the main pollutant in livestock houses and air environment, and its adverse effects on animal and human health have attracted widespread attention. In this study, we performed labeled quantitative proteomic (TMT-MS) analysis in the trachea of fatting pigs exposed to NH3 for 30 days. These proteins were mainly located in intracellular regions and involved in immune response, metabolism and protein synthesis.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is a complex multifactorial disorder that has swift and devastating consequences. Few genes have been consistently identified as prognostic biomarkers of glioblastoma survival. METHODS: A novel analytical strategy was developed to identify general associations between the biomarkers and glioblastoma, and associations that depend on cohort groups, such as race, gender, and therapy. The vast majority of these genes have been previously reported to be associated with glioblastoma (35, 24, and 35 genes, respectively) or with other cancers (10, 19, and 15 genes, respectively) and the rest (16, 4, and 10 genes, respectively) are novel associations. Pik3r1, E2f3, Akr1c3, Csf1, Jag2, Plcg1, Rpl37a, Sod2, Topors, Hras, Mdm2, Camk2g, Fstl1, Il13ra1, Mtap and Tp53 were associated with multiple survival events.Most genes (from 90 to 96%) were associated with survival in a general or cohort-independent manner and thus the same trend is observed across all clinical levels studied. The most extreme associations between profiles and survival were observed for Syne1, Pdcd4, Ighg1, Tgfa, Pla2g7, and Paics. C2, Egfr, Prkcb, Igf2bp3, and Gdf10 had gender-dependent associations; Sox10, Rps20, Rab31, and Vav3 had race-dependent associations; Chi3l1, Prkcb, Polr2d, and Apool had therapy-dependent associations. Biological processes associated glioblastoma survival included morphogenesis, cell cycle, aging, response to stimuli, and programmed cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Known biomarkers of glioblastoma survival were confirmed, and new general and clinical-dependent gene profiles were uncovered. The comparison of biomarkers across glioblastoma phases and functional analyses offered insights into the role of genes. These findings support the development of more accurate and personalized prognostic tools and gene-based therapies that improve the survival and quality of life of individuals afflicted by glioblastoma multiforme.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [Sod2 protein] and [Rpl37a protein] interact with each other?

Human Ataxin-2 gene locus variants have been associated with obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1,and hypertension in genome-wide association studies, whereas mouse studies showed the knock-out of ataxin-2 to lead to obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Intriguingly, the deficiency of ataxin-2 protein orthologs in yeast and flies rescues the neurodegeneration process triggered by TDP-43 and Ataxin-1 toxicity. To understand the molecular effects of ataxin-2 deficiency by unbiased approaches, we quantified the global proteome and metabolome of Atxn2-knock-out mice with label-free mass spectrometry. In liver tissue, significant downregulations of the proteins ACADS, ALDH6A1, ALDH7A1, IVD, MCCC2, PCCA, OTC, together with bioinformatic enrichment of downregulated pathways for branched chain and other amino acid metabolism, fatty acids, and citric acid cycle were observed. They are in good agreement with recent claims that PBP1, the yeast ortholog of ataxin-2, sequestrates the nutrient sensor TORC1 in periods of cell stress.

BACKGROUND: Retinal microglial cells play crucial roles in maintaining normal visual functions in a healthy eye. However, the underlying mechanisms of retinal microglial cells over-activation manifesting the alterations of sensome profile and inflammation state, which contribute to various retinal neurodegenerative diseases, remain elusive. Here, we aimed to identify the core set of sensome and pro-inflammatory genes and their regulators using transcriptome and data mining approaches. METHODS: We performed paired-end RNA-sequencing in primary microglial cell cultures treated with TNFalpha/IFN__ (10 ng/ml for 12 h) and PBS as a control. We examined overlaps of the mouse microglial gene expression profiles with the data-mined human sensome and pro-inflammatory marker genes. The core sets of sensome and pro-inflammatory genes were selected and predicted for transcription factors . RESULTS: TNFalpha/IFN__ induced 668 differentially expressed transcripts in retinal microglial cells relative to the control. The overlapping analysis of the TNFalpha/IFN__-activated microglia genes and the data-mined human gene sets revealed 22 sensome and 61 pro-inflammatory genes. Based on network analysis, we determined 10 genes as the core sets of sensome and pro-inflammatory genes and predicted the top ten transcription factors that regulate them. The SP110, IRF1, FLI1, SP140 (sensome) and RELB, BATF2, NFKB2, TRAFD1, SP100, NFKB1 (inflammation) are differentially expressed between the TNFalpha/IFN__ activated and the non-activated microglia which were validated by quantitative PCR. The outcomes indicate that these transcriptional regulators are highly expressed and may regulate the sensome and inflammatory genes of retinal microglial cells and switch them to over-activation.

In this study, we report the experience of the only reference clinical next-generation sequencing lab in Saudi Arabia with the first 1000 families who span a wide-range of suspected Mendelian phenotypes. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants that explain the clinical indications were identified in 34% (27% in panels and 43% in exomes), spanning 279 genes and including 165 novel variants. The highly consanguineous nature of the study population also facilitated homozygosity for many private mutations (only 32.5% of the recessive mutations are founder), as well as the first instances of recessive inheritance of previously assumed strictly dominant disorders (involving ITPR1, VAMP1, MCTP2, and TBP).

Members of Shc (src homology and collagen homology) family, p46shc, p52shc, p66shc have known to be related to cell proliferation and carcinogenesis. Hence, their expression in cancers needs to be evaluated carefully so that Shc analysis may provide prognostic information in the development of carcinogenesis. In the present study, the expression of p66shc and its associate targets namely epidermal pathway substrate 8, Rac1 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate1) and Grb2 (growth factor receptor bound protein 2) were examined in fresh tissue specimens from patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma using western blot analysis. A thorough analysis of both esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma showed p66shc expression to be significantly higher in both types of carcinomas as compared to the controls. The controls of adenocarcinoma show a higher basal expression level of p66shc as compared to the controls of squamous cell carcinoma. The expression level of downstream targets of p66shc i.e., eps8 and rac1 was also found to be consistently higher in human esophageal carcinomas, and hence correlated positively with p66shc expression. However the expression of grb2 was found to be equal in both esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The above results suggest that the pathway operated by p66shc in cancers does not involve the participation of Ras and Grb2 as downstream targets instead it operates the pathway involving epidermal pathway substrate 8 and Rac1 proteins.

Importance: Breast cancer, a common malignant tumor, ranks first among cancers in terms of morbidity and mortality among female patients. Currently, identifying effective prognostic models has a significant association with the prediction of the overall survival of patients with breast cancer and guidance of clinicians in early diagnosis and treatment. Objectives: To identify a potential DNA repair-related prognostic signature through a comprehensive evaluation and to further improve the accuracy of prediction of the overall survival of patients with breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prognostic study, conducted from October 9, 2019, to February 3, 2020, the gene expression profiles and clinical data of patients with breast cancer were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. This study consisted of a training set from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and 2 validation cohorts from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which included 1096 patients with breast cancer. A prognostic signature based on 8 DNA repair-related genes was developed to predict overall survival among female patients with breast cancer. Finally, a prognostic nomogram, combining the DRG signature and clinical characteristics of patients, was constructed.

2A2600684 2A2497838	IkappaB-alpha	DDIT4	[INST]Context: [PMID: 17039268 Gene expression profiling of breast cancer cells in response to gemcitabine: NF-kappaB pathway activation as a potential mechanism of resistance. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog with clinical relevance in the treatment of several solid tumors, including breast carcinoma. In spite of its cytotoxic effect, clinical efficacy is impaired by the development of resistance. We performed gene expression analysis to shed light into the molecular mechanism of action of this drug in two breast cancer cell lines. Activation of genes related with cell cycle, cell growth and apoptosis (BNIP3L, CCNG2, DDIT4, TGFB2, TP53BP1, TP53INP1, and VEGF) was the main finding in the p53-wild type cell line MCF7, while the p53-non-functional cell line MDA-MB-231 was characterized by the regulation of NF-kappaB target genes (BIRC3, CXCL1/GRO1, IRAK2, TNF, TNFAIP and TRAF1). Genes consistently induced (ATF3, CCNG2, CDKN1A, EGR1, INSIG1, and MAF) or repressed (CCND1 and VGF) in both cell lines, were also found after gemcitabine treatment. In addition, MDA-MB-231 cells showed a higher basal and induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity after treatment with gemcitabine. In comparison with gemcitabine, gene expression after 5-fluorouracil treatment showed essentially different profiles in both cell lines. This, in spite of using equitoxic concentrations producing similar effects on cell cycle. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in MDA-MB-231 cells was dependent on IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation, as shown by functional experiments using the specific inhibitor BAY11-7082.

Application of a three-dimensional (3D) culture system for in vitro proliferation and differentiation of human spermatogonial stem cells is a useful tool for the investigation of the spermatogenesis process and the management of male infertility particularly in prepubertal cancer patients. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the proliferation of human spermatogonial stem cells co-cultured with Sertoli cells in soft agar culture system supplemented by Laminin and growth factors. Testicular cells were isolated from testes of brain-dead patients and cultured in two-dimensional (2D) culture system for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, functional spermatogonial stem cells were evaluated by xenotransplantation and also identification of cells was assessed by immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and RT-PCR. Then, spermatogonial stem cells and Sertoli cells were transferred to the upper layer of soft agar culture system for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, the number of colonies and the expression of specific spermatogonial stem cells and Sertoli cell markers, as well as apoptotic genes were evaluated. Our results showed that transplanted spermatogonial stem cells, migrated into the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules of recipient mice. The expression of PLZF, alpha6-Integrin, and Vimentin proteins in spermatogonial stem cells and Sertoli cells were observed in 2D and 3D culture systems. The expression rate of PLZF, alpha6-Integrin, Bcl2, and colony number in soft agar culture system supplemented by Laminin and growth factors group were significantly higher than non-supplemented groups (P__^_____^0.01), but the expression rate of c-kit and Bax in supplemented group were significantly lower than non-supplemented groups (P__^_____^0.05). This 3D co-culture system decreased apoptosis and increased propagation of human spermatogonial stem cells. Therefore, this designed system can be utilized to increase the proliferation of human spermatogonial stem cells in prepubertal male cancer and azoospermic men to obtain an adequate spermatogonial stem cells number to outotransplant success and in vitro spermatogenesis.

Spermatogonial stem cells are very sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, so male infertility is a great challenge for prepubertal cancer survivors. Cryoconservation of testicular cells before cancer treatment can preserve spermatogonial stem cells from treatment side effects. Different two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) culture systems of spermatogonial stem cells have been used in many species as a useful technique to in vitro spermatogenesis.

STUDY QUESTION: Can human spermatogonia be detected in long-term primary testicular cell cultures using validated, germ cell-specific markers of spermatogonia? SUMMARY ANSWER: Germ cell-specific markers of spermatogonia/spermatogonial stem cells are detected in early (1-2 weeks) but not late (> 6 weeks) primary testicular cell cultures; WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The development of conditions for human SSC culture is critically dependent on the ability to define cell types unequivocally and to quantify spermatogonia/SSCs. Growth by somatic cells presents a major challenge in the establishment of SSC cultures and therefore markers that define spermatogonia/SSCs, but are not also expressed by testicular somatic cells, are essential for accurate characterization of SSC cultures. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Testicular tissue from eight organ donors with normal spermatogenesis was used for assay validation and establishing primary testicular cell cultures. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Immunofluorescence analysis of normal human testicular tissue was used to validate antibodies (UTF1, SALL4, DAZL and VIM) and then the antibodies were used to demonstrate that primary testicular cells cultured in vitro for 1-2 weeks were composed of somatic cells and rare germ cells. Primary testicular cell cultures were further characterized by comparing to testicular somatic cell cultures using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (UTF1, FGFR3, ZBTB16, GPR125, DAZL, GATA4 and VIM) and flow cytometry (CD9 and SSEA4). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: UTF1, FGFR3, DAZL and ZBTB16 qRT-PCR and SSEA4 flow cytometry were validated for the sensitive, quantitative and specific detection of germ cells. In contrast, GPR125 mRNA and CD9 were found to be not specific to germ cells because they were also expressed in testicular somatic cell cultures. After 6 weeks in culture only somatic cells were detected. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Different groups attempting SSC culture have utilized different sources of human testes and minor differences in the preparation and maintenance of the testicular cell cultures. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The ability to propagate human spermatogonia/spermatogonial stem cells in vitro is a prerequisite for proposed autologous transplantation therapy aimed at restoring fertility to men who have been treated for childhood cancer. By applying the assays validated here it will be possible to quantitatively compare human SSC culture conditions. The eventual development of conditions for long-term propagation of human spermatogonia/spermatogonial stem cells in vitro will greatly facilitate learning about the basic biology of these cells and in turn the ability to use human spermatogonia/spermatogonial stem cells in therapy.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [VIM protein] and [ZBTB16 protein] interact with each other?

BACKGROUND: Lung squamous cell carcinoma is a major histological subtype of lung cancer. In this study, we investigated genomic alterations in lung squamous cell carcinoma and evaluated the clinical implications of mutation burden in lung squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: Genomic alterations were determined in Japanese patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma (N = 67) using next-generation sequencing of 415 known cancer genes. Programmed death-ligand 1 protein expression in cancer cells was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: TP53 gene mutations were the most common alteration (n = 51/67, 76.1%), followed by gene alterations in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B; 35.8%), CDKN2A (31.3%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (30.0%), and sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2, 28.3%). Moreover, cancers in the upper or middle lobes had significantly higher mutation burden than cancers in the lower lobes (p = 0.0005), and tended to show higher programmed death-ligand 1 protein expression (p = 0.0573). SOX2 and tyrosine kinase non-receptor 2 amplifications were associated with high mutation burden (p = 0.0065 and p = 0.0010, respectively).

We employed the BeadArraytrade mark technology to perform a genetic analysis in 33 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human esophageal carcinomas, mostly squamous-cell-carcinoma (ESCC), and their adjacent normal tissues. This directly targeted genomic profiling identified not only previously reported somatic gene amplifications (e.g., CCND1) and deletions (e.g., CDKN2A and CDKN2B) but also novel genomic aberrations. Among these novel targets, the most frequently deleted genomic regions were chromosome 3p (including tumor suppressor genes FANCD2 and CTNNB1) and chromosome 5 (including tumor suppressor gene APC). The most frequently amplified genomic region was chromosome 3q (containing DVL3, MLF1, ABCC5, BCL6, AGTR1 and known oncogenes TNK2, TNFSF10, FGF12). The chromosome 3p deletion and 3q amplification occurred coincidently in nearly all of the affected cases, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the generation of somatic chromosomal aberrations.

Background: Mountainous evidence has revealed that an activated immune response in the heart can provoke left ventricular dysfunction and result in adverse cardiac remodelling. This study was designed to explore the potential mechanisms and identify core biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of nonischaemic cardiomyopathy . Methods: GSE9128, particularly, the samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 3 control individuals and 4 nonischaemic cardiomyopathy patients, was downloaded from the GEO database to identify differentially expressed genes .

Hydrogen sulfide is an endogenous gasotransmitter in human physiology and inflammatory disease, however, with limited knowledge of how signal transduction pathways are involved in immune cells. To examine the effects of sulfide on relevant intracellular signaling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we stimulated healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells with sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, 1-1000muM) to mimic hydrogen sulfide stimulation, and analyzed phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (pT180/pY182), NF-kappaB p65 (pS529), Akt (pS473) and CREB/ATF1 (pS133/pS63) with flow and mass cytometry. In contrast to transient effects in subsets of lymphocytes, classical monocytes demonstrated sustained phosphorylation of p38, Akt and CREB/ATF1. NaHS induced calcium dependent phosphorylation of p38, Akt and CREB, but not NF-kappaB, and the phosphorylation of Akt was partly dependent on p38, indicative of p38-Akt crosstalk. Attenuation of these effects by molecules targeting p38 and Hsp90 indicated Hsp90 as a possible target for H2S-induced activation of p38.

2A2445850 2A2450692	BMP1	CA2	[INST]Context: [PMID: 19303468 Identification of differentially expressed genes in trabecular bone from the iliac crest of osteoarthritic patients. OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis is clinically characterized by degeneration of the joints and has been traditionally considered a primary disorder of articular cartilage, with secondary changes in the subchondral bone. The increased bone mass and generalized changes in bone quality observed in osteoarthritic patients suggest that osteoarthritis may be a primary systemic bone disorder with secondary articular cartilage damage. To provide evidence that osteoarthritis is a systemic disorder, we searched for differentially expressed genes in the iliac crest bone of patients suffering from hip osteoarthritis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression levels between bone samples collected at surgery from the iliac crest of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty for primary osteoarthritis and younger donors, who were undergoing spinal arthrodesis, were investigated by means of oligonucleotide microarrays. To verify data detected by microarrays technology, Real Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction assays were performed with specimens from osteoarthritic patients and donors, as well as from elderly donors who were undergoing arthroplasty for subcapital femoral neck fracture. RESULTS: The microarray analysis surveyed 8327 genes and identified 83 whose expression levels differed at least 1.5-fold in the osteoarthritis group (P<0.005). Comparisons between Real Time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction data from osteoarthritis and the two donor groups indicated differential expression of genes involved in bone cell functions in the group of osteoarthritis patients. The genes identified, including CCL2, FOS, PRSS11, DVL2, AKT1, CA2, BMP6, OMD, MMP2, TGFBR3, FLT1, BMP1 and TNFRS11B, have known roles in osteoblast or osteoclast activities. CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study identify a set of genes, closely related to bone cell functions, in which differential regulation in osteoarthritic bone distant from the diseased subchondral bone might underlie the etiopathogenesis of osteoarthritis as a generalized bone disease.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [BMP1 protein] and [CA2 protein] interact with each other?

We recently demonstrated that interleukin-6 - and vascular endothelial growth factor -induced osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration are parallel to significant increased expression of SH3GL1 and the phosphorylation level of P130cas. The expression level of SH3GL1 was widely upregulated in human osteosarcoma tissues, and their overexpression was significantly correlated with more aggressive clinicopathological features. Conversely, depletion of SH3GL1 by adenovirus shRNA abrogates P130cas phosphorylation and IL-6- and VEGF-induced osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration. To further pinpoint the mechanism how SH3GL1 was responsible for cell proliferation and migration, we deleted SH3GL1 in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, depletion of SH3GL1 abrogates P130cas phosphorylation and IL-6- and VEGF-induced osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration. SH3GL1 knockdown caused cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase via downregulation of cyclin D1, caused activation of p27KIP, and attenuated the activation of p-Rb. Interestingly, SH3GL1 knockdown also markedly attenuated the phosphorylation level of Akt/GSK-3beta/FAK. In vivo, depletion of SH3GL1 by shRNA inhibited the tumor tissue growth and the expression of p-P130cas. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that SH3GL1 is a novel target for anti-osteosarcoma.] Question: Based on the provided context, do the terms [SH3GL1 protein] and [interleukin-6 protein] interact with each other?

Exon-amplification experiments were undertaken to isolate potentially transcribable sequences from cosmid clones that previously had been mapped to subchromosomal bands of human chromosome 8 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

2A2497730 2A2508404	DDB1	DNMT1	[INST]Context: [PMID: 29423093 Combination of a hypomethylating agent and inhibitors of PARP and Hdecitabine traps PARP1 and DNMT1 to chromatin, acetylates DNA repair proteins, down-regulates nucleosome-remodeling deacetylase and induces apoptosis in human leukemia and lymphoma cells. Combination of drugs that target different aspects of aberrant cellular processes is an efficacious treatment for hematological malignancies. We hypothesized that their combination would be synergistically cytotoxic to leukemia and lymphoma cells. Exposure of AML and lymphoma cell lines to the combination of the PARPi niraparib, the HMA decitabine and the HDACi romidepsin or panobinostat synergistically inhibited cell proliferation by up to 70% via activation of the ATM pathway, increased production of reactive oxygen species, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated apoptosis. Addition of the DNA alkylating agents busulfan and/or melphalan enhanced the anti-proliferative/cytotoxic effects of the triple-drug combination. [Npb+DAC+Rom] significantly increased the level of chromatin-bound PARP1 and DNMT1 and caused acetylation of DNA repair proteins, including Ku70, Ku80, PARP1, DDB1, ERCC1 and XPF/ERCC4. Addition of busulfan to this combination further enhanced these effects on nucleosome-remodeling deacetylase. The trapping of PARP1 and DNMT1 to chromatin, acetylation of DNA repair proteins, and down-regulation of nucleosome-remodeling deacetylase may all have increased double-strand DNA break formation as suggested by activation of the DNA-damage response, concomitantly resulting in tumor cell death. Similar synergistic cytotoxicity was observed in blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with AML and lymphoma.

Cardiac remodelling following myocardial infarction is a maladaptive change associated with progressive heart failure and compromises long-term clinical outcome. A substantial proportion of patients afflicted by myocardial infarction still develop adverse outcomes associated with cardiac remodelling. An in-depth proteomics approach, including both semi-quantitative and quantitative antibody arrays, was used to identify circulating biomarkers that may be associated with detrimental cardiac remodelling. Furthermore, statistical correlation analysis was performed between the candidate biomarkers and clinical cardiac remodelling data to demonstrate their clinical utility. A systematic proteomics approach revealed that sclerostin (SOST), growth differentiation factor-15, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and midkine were increased, while monocyte chemotactic protein-3 was uniquely decreased in myocardial infarction patients who developed cardiac remodelling, compared to myocardial infarction patients who did not develop cardiac remodelling and healthy humen. Moreover, correlation analyses between serum proteomes and cardiac remodelling echocardiographic parameters demonstrated a moderate positive association between left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and the three serum proteins, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, midkine and growth differentiation factor-15 (P < .05, respectively), and a moderate negative correlation between LV ejection fraction and these serum proteins (P < .05, respectively). Importantly, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and midkine were firstly identified to be associated with the development of cardiac remodelling.
